# March 16th, 2018, Chunkung, day 6 (4730m)

We made to chukung, and found this great lodge. Where we can stay for free. The food price here seems to be lower too. Which I assume is due to lack of trekker at this part of trail.

Both Tim and Dan are struggling with the height now. And I am slowly getting there. Hopefully we can try to tackle Chunkung Ri (5550) tomorrow.

We did a practise hike to a nearby Hill top that really helped, desire our struggles. I am feeling a little tingle in my hands. When moving it, hopefully it is not due to the cold, not altitude.

# March 17th, 2018, Chunkung, day 7 (5550m)

Today being our rest day. We took the trip to top of Chunkung Ri. Holyshit it is a hard climbe. I was very much out of breath at top. The feeling of suffocating, then some dizziness.

We are slightly worried about tomorrow's pass through Kong Ma La. As of 3:30PM now there is heavy snow fall starting, really worried it will effect the trek tomorrow.
