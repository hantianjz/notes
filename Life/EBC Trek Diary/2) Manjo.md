# March 12th, 2018, Manjo, day 2 (2835m)

Breakfast at Mount kailash lodge. So far everything is pretty good. Met Daniel and Tim yesterday, and had fun. Daniel might be going the same way as I am for part of way.

Physical strength wise still all good. Leg is adjusting fine. Have some trouble with up hills but that is mostly expected.

The last stretch into namche was hard. Feeling the height so much now.
