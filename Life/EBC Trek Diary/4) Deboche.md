# March 14th, 2018, Deboche, Day 4 (3820m)

Long day hiked of continuous up hills to top of Tengboche. The town of Tengboche seemed empty with lots of empty fields. We opted to continue moving and get to Deboche, which is lower than Tenboche. We played cards alone all night, and found some nice stars before going to sleep.
