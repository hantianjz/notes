# What is Hayes commands set AKA AT Commands
The **Hayes command set** (also known as the **AT command set**) is a specific [command language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_language "Command language") originally developed by [Dennis Hayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hayes_(businessman) "Dennis Hayes (businessman)")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_command_set#cite_note-ModemKing.NYT-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_command_set#cite_note-2) for the [Hayes Smartmodem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_Microcomputer_Products#The_Smartmodem "Hayes Microcomputer Products") 300 [baud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud "Baud") [modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem "Modem") in 1981.

The command set consists of a series of short text strings which can be combined to produce commands for operations such as dialing, hanging up, and changing the parameters of the connection. The vast majority of dial-up modems use the Hayes command set in numerous variations.

The command set covered only those operations supported by the earliest 300 bit/s modems. When new commands were required to control additional functionality in higher speed modems, a variety of one-off standards emerged from each of the major vendors. These continued to share the basic command structure and syntax, but added any number of new commands using some sort of prefix character – `&` for Hayes and [USR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USRobotics "USRobotics"), and `\` for [Microcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcom "Microcom"), for instance. Many of these were re-standardized on the Hayes extensions after the introduction of the [SupraFAXModem 14400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SupraFAXModem_14400 "SupraFAXModem 14400") and the market consolidation that followed.
