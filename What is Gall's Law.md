# Gall's Law

[[Systemantics]]: [How systems really work and how they fail.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemantics)

> “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.”
