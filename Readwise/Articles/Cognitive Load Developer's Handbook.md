- Prefer composition over inheritance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1aw98s02x4tq130s0tmkank))
    - Note: Object inheritance increase cognitive load by extending information. Composition create encapsulation allow single complex idea to be represented by a single entity.

- We can write code in a somewhat framework-agnostic way. The business logic should not reside within a framework; rather, it should use the framework's components. Put a framework outside of your core logic. Use the framework in a library-like fashion. This would allow new contributors to add value from day one, without the need of going through debris of framework-related complexity first.
