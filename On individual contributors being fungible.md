# On individual contributors

- Most larger engineer teams tend to treat individual as fungible, making planning, overall abstraction more simpler and legible to understand and reason about.
- Measuring progress assuming everyone have the same contribution.
- Decision maker needing the problem to be abstracted to be easier to reason about.
- It's hard to understand or measure the intangible work return
- Not all ROI can be easily measured, hence decision make opt for suboptimal solution/investment where return can be measured.

> One thing I've found very interesting in large organisations is when they realise that they need to do something different (i.e. they're slowly failing and want to turn the ship around). The obvious thing is to let a small team take risks on the basis that they might win big. Instead they tend to form endless committees which just perpetuate the drift that caused the committees to be formed in the first place! I think this is because they really struggle to see people as anything other than fungible, even if they really want to: it's almost beyond their ability to break out of their organisational mould, even when it spells long-term doom.

- A large organization does not always make overall best decisions
