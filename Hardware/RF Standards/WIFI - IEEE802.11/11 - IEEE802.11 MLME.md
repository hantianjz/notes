# Clause 11.1 Synchronization

Member STAs of a BSS sync to a commom clock. Each STA maintain a Timing Synchronization Function (TSF), multiband device maintain a TSF for each channel operating on.

AP is timing master of TSF. Transmit Beacon frames and Announce frames periodically. (TSF or MAC timestamp)
Non-DMG BSS transmit Beacon frame every dot11BeaconPeriod (Some nuance 11.28.4.1)
DMG BSS, slightly flexiable, shall transmit at least 1 Beacon frame each sector within dot11BeaconPeriod X dot11MaxLostBeacons. TXSS Span field less than dot11MaxLostBeacons
(PBSS is also a little different, and too complicated to care.)
TFS in IBSS is implemented via a distributed algorithm by all member of BSS. STA will adopt TSF from any member STA which have a later value than its own.
MBSS use TSF provided by active synchronization method. (14.13.2)

TSF maintained as 64 bit value in microseconds.
TSF timestamp starting from first bit to PHY, plus delay from MAC-PHY to Wireless Medium (antenna) interface.
DMG beacon, or Announce frame set timestamp from first transmission of first bit of MPDU (Derived from PHY-TXHEADEREND.indication primitive)

Non-DMG AP strictly enforce dot11BeaconPeriod, suspend pending individually addressed transmissions until pending group addressed transmission.
Beacon period is included in Beason and Probe Response frames, STA shall adopt beacon period when join BSS. AP will use long slot time, post association for STA lack short slot time support. (Clause 18)

An AP support TX and RX Space-Time Block Codes (STBC) may transmit STBC Beacon frame and group address traffic using STBC MCS. (10.7.3)
STBC Beacon frame shall sets Dual Beacon field to 1, VHT shall set Dual Beacon to 0. Target Beacon Transmission Time (TBTT) for STBC Beacon frame offset by half of beacon interval from TBTT of non-STBC Beacon frame. STBC Beacon frame differ only at STBC, TIM, TSF fields from non-STBC Beacon frame.

Dual beacon is deprecated.

DMG STA follow DMG channel access procedure (10.36).
TODO read 11.1.3.3-11.1.3.6 Skipping DMG BSS, IBSS, MBSS



## Clause 11.1.4 accquiring synchronization

## Clause 11.9 DFS Procedures

use 11.9.1 to 11.9.9 when dot11SpectrumManagementRequired == true
use 11.9.10 if dot11SpectrumManagementRequired == true and dot11FutureChannelGuidanceActivated = true

DFS procedure provide:
- STA associating to AP based on STA supported channels
- Quieting channel to test for radar
- Testing for radar before operating
- Discontinuing operation on channel detected with radar
- Detecting radar
- request & report measurements
- select advertise new channel to mitigation
- Hint future channel to STA in case AP leave

STA shall provide list of supported channel to AP. AP may employee channel selection algorithm to select new channel. (Actually selection algorithm is implementation detail)
In DMS BSS, AP may advertise via Information Response frame, of all intersection of channels supported by STAs associated with BSS.

Quiet Channel element is a mode set Quiet Channel element. AP (or mesh STA) may schedule quiet intervals by transmitting quiet channel element, or quiet element in beacon frames and probe response frames.

AP shall not transmit Quiet channel element if BSS bandwidth is neither 160MHz nor 80+80 MHz. Non-VHT AP shall not transmit Quiet channel element.

AP (or mesh STA) may stop scheduling quiet intervals or transmit Quiet element with changes. Most recent Beacon frame, or probe response define future quiet intervals.

AP (in DMG BSS) may measure on channels it self, or request associated AP in same BSS to measure, either dedicated interval or during normal operation.

*** There is a bunch of nuances here regarding quieting channel, on when, who can do what ***

STA does not transmit in channel unless channel has been tested for radar. If radar is detected, or detection from another STA is accepted, then STA stop transmissions. ** Standard does not specify how to detect radar transmissions **

AP/STA may send Measurement Request frame to other STAs/AP in same BSS, individual or group destination address, direction depend on service set type. After successfully Measurement Request STA should not transmit MSDU A-MSDU, or MMPDU to STA, for the duration of measurement interval and channel switch time.

Channel switching might not always move all STAs, channel switch procedure vs extended channel switching procedure. Distinct from regulatory requirement to cease transmission on particular channel. Decision to switch channel should only be made by AP. AP advertise via Channel switch announcement element in Beacon frames, Probe response frames, and Channel switch announcement frames.
