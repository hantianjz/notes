# Vehicle detection

# Camera image processing
Image processing have to deal with various difficult lighting conditions.

[yolo](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) Real time object detection lib.

**Pros:**
- HW readily available
- ML image processing something Google is strong at
- Many image processing stack readily available for vehicle detection, and high accuracy in ideal conditions

**Cons:**
- To cover multiple spots will be difficult, each installation will require unique setup and tailored ML detection algorithm. Will be hard to scale.
- Require long algorithm development time, and long tail development improvement period.
- Might always be limited in certain locations due to lighting
