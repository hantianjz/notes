To compress that a little, complex adaptive systems have the following properties, as laid out by [John Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Holland):

- they are made up of agents that act in parallel.
- the properties of such systems emerge out of competition and collaboration amongst these agents.
- they tend to have many levels of organisation, with different properties and behaviours emerging at each level.
- all complex adaptive systems anticipate the future and act according to their predictions, and
- complex adaptive systems are dynamic, and generate new niches and interconnections between those niches over time
