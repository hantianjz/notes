# On team culture

Most old school leaders strongly advocate for organization to create a culture to influence and direct people instead of solely based on *incentive* and *process*.

For example, if we look at manufacturing defect rate, some countries persistently have lower defect rates than others on a timescale of decades[1](https://danluu.com/culture/#fn:C), generally robust across companies, even when companies are operating factories in multiple countries and importing the same process and incentives to each factory to the extent that's possible, due to cultural differences that impact how people work.

One way in which culture influences this is that people often absorb their ideas of what's possible from the culture they're in.

> One component of this was that there was a culture of owning problems, regardless of what team you were on. If you saw a problem, you'd fix it, or, if there was a very obvious owner, you'd tell them about the problem and they'd fix it. There weren't roadmaps, standups, kanban, or anything else to get people to work on important problems. People did it without needed to be reminded or prompted.

> When you have a collection of people who care about quality and feel that no issue is off limits, you'll get quality. And when you onboard people, as long as you don't do it so quickly that the culture is overwhelmed by the new hires, they'll also tend to pick up the same habits and values, especially when you hire new grads. While it's not exactly common, there are plenty of small firms out there with a culture of excellence that generally persists without heavyweight processes or big incentives, but this doesn't work at big tech companies since they've all gone through a hypergrowth period where it's impossible to maintain such extreme (by mainstream standards) cultural values.

The team/social/company cultural drives a lot of our subtle behaviors
