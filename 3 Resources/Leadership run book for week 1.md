# Leadership run book for week 1

If you get hired or promoted to lead a new team, 

Here’s the playbook to run on Week 1:

**1/ Get an Intro** 

Let the person who called your number: 

-> set the context
-> front-run the objections
-> start planting seeds of your success

Third-party praise is more potent than tooting your own horn. 

And this allows you to...

**2/ Lead with Your Faults & Failures**

Of course, you’ve been fortunate.

But they will not trust you if you don’t know how to lose.

Even better, by leading with vulnerability, you:

-> neutralize any power those mistakes hold
-> show your new team how to engage

**3/ Look Each Person in the Eye**

Have you ever built a meaningful relationship from a blast email?   Me neither. 

And in our remote-first world, run-ins are infrequent. 

So even if it means you have to be on 15-minute Zooms all day, do it.

**4/ Learn Everyone's Name**

If you can pull it off in advance, I would.

If it feels like a magic trick when others do it, that's because it is.

You instantly pull someone a step closer when you address them by name.

Bonus: Uncover 1 thing they value. Family? Travel? Sports Team?

**5 / Ask Everyone 3 Questions** 

What is this team world-class at?
-> Do not break this. 

What has been persistently broken?
-> Find quick wins & monsters to slay.

What's the most impactful investment we can make?
-> Anticipate where the puck is going next.

**6/ Orchestrate a Small Fire Drill**

Keyword: Small. 1 alarm fire, not 4.

What you want: Data

-> Business data: metrics, financials, survey results, HR trends, project plans.

-> Metadata: who has a handle on their work vs. who is scrambling?

No judgment, just data.

**7/ Over-communicate**

On Friday, send a quick Loom video: 

-> What has you excited?
-> What surprised you to learn? 
-> What new questions do you have?
-> What should they expect next week?

People are most anxious in times of change. 

Invite them into the conversation.
