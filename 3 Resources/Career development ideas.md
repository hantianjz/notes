# Career development ideas

1. Invest a portion of your time each week on your own growth. Work and deadlines are all flexible and 2 hrs a week on a Friday is nothing.

2. Find a way to keep track of tasks, including follow up. Make sure it’s not too detailed, and not too high level.

3. Identity gaps and opportunities, risks and assumptions and verbalize them and create action. Don’t try to address it all yourself, first see who is best to solve it and assign it to them. Doesn’t matter how low you are, at L4 I requested actions from directors etc. they thank you for it. Follow up if it doesn’t get done.

4. Initiate projects. Brainstorm and think of things that could have high impact and draft a quick and dirty 1 pager. Start shopping it around but don’t get attached. Modify or get rid of it. Keep coming with ideas even if the first 3 or so don’t work out. Be part of roadmapping.

5. Promotion has to do with higher ups knowing you, your work, and having a positive feeling about it. It’s not about kissing up but ensuring you are getting face time with them. Best way is to involve them more in your project, ask for early feedback, feedback before taking in front of other leads, etc. You can sign up to show you work to your team or product area, send announcement emails, etc. be visible, they can’t know your work if they don’t ever see it. Also, go to those work events, hang out, get to know people on a personal level.

6. Prioritize! Huge one. Learn when to say no or yes but this is low priority and I’m not sure when I will be able to get to it. Saying yes to low impact things will bog you down. Spending your entire day responding to chats and emails and looking to X for someone’s one off comment during a meeting, this will eat at your impact. Doesn’t mean don’t help your team, or anyone else just use wisdom and prioritize the stuff you need to get done.
