# How to decide to read a book

A book's value to each person may vary depending on the context.
The context of the person's current state of mind, their current experience, who they are and their background.

Some types of context useful to judge a book:
1. My fantasies, sci-fi fantasies book that always interest me
2. What is new to me? Certain subject or details might be already very familiar to me and not worth repeating
3. What am I ready for? Certain topic/subject might be too advanced for me to consume right now, if I don't have the right level of context of background knowledge.
4. What am I doing right now? At our current point in life what am I doing? How does a new book help me? Would I best benefit from it?

Just skipping the sections/books that aren't good.

When dropping a book, try to think
> [!Dropping a Book]
>  "It's not me. It's not the book. It's just not the book for me right now."
