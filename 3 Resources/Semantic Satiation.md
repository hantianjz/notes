**Semantic satiation** is a psychological phenomenon in which repetition causes a word or phrase to temporarily lose meaning who then perceives the speech as repeated meaningless sounds. 
Extended inspection or analysis (staring at the word or phrase for a long time) in place of repetition also produces the same effect.
