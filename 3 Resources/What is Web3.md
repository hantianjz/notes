# What is Web3

> It is just current distributed system sprinkled with some cryptocurrency or blockchain.

https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/web3-fraud
> Web3 is only about adding an additional layer of complexity in the name of justifying the underlying cryptocurrencies.
> The web browser is augmented with a cryptocurrency wallet and part of the computation and storage is shifted from my server to the decentralized cryptocurrency infrastructure.  When a user wants to use my service they will pay some amount of cryptocurrency to perform the cryptocurrency-side computation, with any remaining transferred to me as a fee for my service.

> To begin with, [[Ethereum]] has the notion of coupling a small program to the transfer of Ethereum.  

> So why this hype?  Because the cryptocurrency space, at heart, is simply a giant [[ponzi scheme]] where the only way early participants make money is if there are further suckers entering the space.

> The measure of the amount of compute is called “gas”, with various instructions and operations costing a different amount of gas to process.  The total cost of a transaction is the amount of gas consumed times the gas price.
