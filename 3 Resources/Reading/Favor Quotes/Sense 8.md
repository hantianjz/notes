# Quotes from Sense 8
> [!quote]
We live in a world that distrust feelings. Over and over, we are reminded that feelings are not as important as reason.
That feelings are childish irresponsible, dangerous. We are taught to ignore them, control or deny them.
We barely understand what they are, where they come from, or how they seem to understand is better than we understand ourselves.
But I know a that feelings matter. Sometimes they are little, sometime they are huge. However if you are lucky, a feeling comes along that will change everything.
