> In transporting the breath, the inhalation must be full.

> When it is full, it has big capacity. When it has big capacity, it can be extended. When it is extended, it can penetrate downward. When it penetrates downward, it will become calmly settled. When it is calmly settled, it will be strong and firm. When it is strong and firm, it will germinate. When it germinates, it will grow. When it grows, it will retreat upward.
> 
> When it retreats upward, it will reach the top of the head. The secret power of Providence moves above.

> The secret power of the Earth moves below.
> 
> He who follows this will live. He who acts against this will die.
