# Notes on The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck: # A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life

# ✍️ My Top 3 Quotes

> What most pampered people consider “life problems” are really just side effects of not having anything more important to worry about.

> Just because something feels good doesn’t mean it is good. Just because something feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad. Emotions are merely signposts or suggestions. Make a habit of questioning them.

# 📒 Summary + Notes

> The desire for more positive experience is it self a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience.

> There is no value in suffering when it is done without purpose.

> Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance.

> Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience.

> Solve problem; be happy

> Pick solvable problems.

# Subtleties
- Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.
- To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.
- Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.

> Emotions are simply biological signals designed to nudge you in the direction of beneficial change.

## Hedonic treadmill

> What you willing to struggle for in your life?

> The person you marry is the person you fight with. The house you buy is the house you repair. The dream job you take is the job you stress over.
> Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice—whatever makes us feel good will also inevitably make us feel bad.

> true and accurate measurement of one’s self-worth is how people feel about the negative aspects of themselves.

> Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times.
1. first layer of the self-awareness onion is a simple understanding of one’s emotions.
2. The second layer of the self-awareness onion is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions.
3. The third level is our personal values: Why do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me?

> If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.

> This is why these values—pleasure, material success, always being right, staying positive—are poor ideals for a person’s life. Some of the greatest moments of one’s life are not pleasant, not successful, not known, and not positive.

> our struggle determines our success.

> Why is something nothing you? What does that seem true.

Our value, the metric to measure it.

Problems may be inevitable, but the meaning of each problem is not.

> Our value determine the metrics by which we measure out selves and everyone else

Some value leads to good problems easier to be solved. And other values lead to bad problems, not easily solved.

1.  Responsibility
2.  Uncertainty
3.  Failure
4.  Say, hear NO
5.  Mortality


> The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.
