# Notes on Good Arguments

## Topic: How to find the debate
Three types of disagreement
- Facts
    - X is Y
    - Empirically observable features of the world.
    - I.E. "The crime rate in Paris was lower in 2014 than in 2016."
- Judgements 
    - Normative disagreements on our subjective judgments
    - The way things should or ought to be
    - I.E. "Lying should be considered immoral"
- Prescriptions
    - Prescriptive disagreements relate to what we should do.
    - C should do action D
    - I.E. "We should get a gym membership"

Arguing is mainly to disentangle the threads of disagreements and chart a course for resolving some of them.

| Disagree     | Details  | Reasoning | Approach |
| ------------ | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| Fact         | Disagree | Agree     | Agree    |
| Judgment     | Agree    | Disagree  | Agree    |
| Prescription | Agree    | Agree     | Disagree |

| Agree        | Details  | Reasoning | Approach |
| ------------ | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| Fact         | Agree    | Disagree  | Disagree |
| Judgment     | Disagree | Agree     | Disagree |
| Prescription | Disagree | Disagree  | Agree    |

## Argument: How to make a point

> [!What is an Argument]
> An argument is a conclusion about the way things are, or ought to be, that is justified by a main claim and a set of supporting reasons and evidence.

1. Start with conclusion, the fact, judgment, or prescription that one is trying to convince the listener to accept.

> Bob is not a nice person. **(Conclusion)**

2. Take conclusion add *because* 

> Bob is not a nice person, because he is inconsiderate of other people's feelings. **(Main claim)**

3. Take main claim and add *because*. This is the reason in favor of the claim.

> Bob is inconsiderate, because he is often cruel to others, including his friends. **(Reason)**

4. Support the reason with evidence, a fact from the real world.

There can always be more and better reason and **evidence**.

> A conclusion that is justified by a main claim and a set of supporting reasons and evidence.

But we also need to proof that the main claim justify conclusion.

"Two burdens of proof"
- **Truth:** the main claim is factually correct or otherwise believable.
- **Importance:** the main claim supports its conclusion.

> **Truth**: Bob is, in fact, inconsiderate of other people's feelings.
> **Importance**: If bob is inconsiderate, we should conclude he is not nice.

Four Ws:
- **What** is the point?
- **Why** is it true?
- **When** has it happened before?
- **Who cares**?

## Rebuttal: How to push back
There are several ways to show an argument fails to meet its burdens:
- Factually incorrect
- Lack evidence
- Inconclusive
- Unimportant
- Logical Leap
- Relevance
- Outweighed 
- Better alternatives
- Competing considerations

## Rhetoric: How to move people

### Rule #1 No abstract words
Don't replace a word with the category to which it belongs, or use an abstract word when a more concrete one will do. We may be tempted to use this move to make our arguments seem more widely applicable and important. But that actual effect is to make our point harder to follow.
**Bad**: Our educational institutions are failing.
**Good**: Our schools and colleges are underfunded.

### Rule #2 No confusing metaphors
Treat metaphors like an overwhelmingly power spice: account for each one that you use, and almost never mix them. Note that some common fragments of language are, in fact, metaphors-"Separate the wheat from the chaff."
**Bad**: Injustice reigns and pervades the air that we breathe.
**Good**: Injustice reigns and make the subjects of us all.

### Rule #3 No excess qualification
Qualifications, exceptions, and counterarguments can wait until the main point has been established. In a bid to be faultless we fail the more basic task of getting the message out.
**Bad**: The right to life, notwithstanding the complications of how we define that term, is one of the more important rights we have.
**Good**: The right to life is paramount.

### Rule #4 No buried ledes
Start with the conclusion of your argument, and say the minimum amount required to prove it. This way we know where the argument is heading and whether we are on track.
**Bad**: On one hand, the proposal is cost-effective, but I worry about the PR risks...so I would lean against it.
**Good**: We should not adopt this proposal. This is how I see the trade-offs...

### Rule #5 No thoughtless repetition
Don't repeat the message without considering what the repetition will help you achieve. In general, many versions of the same claim dilute the message and, if the listener is unprepared to hear the point in this form, feel overwhelming. One rule of thumb: when you're 80 percent satisfied with how you have delivered the message, move on.
**Bad**: The kids are unhappy about their new school. Their discontent is palpable. The school is not working out for them at all. They say it is horrible.
**Good**: The kids are palpably unhappy with their new school. We need to do something.

### Rule #6 No emoting
Make sure the tone of your words fits the thin you are trying to describe. Otherwise it becomes emoting-a performance in which emotions no longer correspond to the situation at hand. The most obvious forms are exaggeration and euphemism.

### Rule #7 No insinuation
Don't imply a conclusion that you are unwilling to directly defend. One common technique is dog-whistling, or the use of coded language to hint at a position that one can later deny. Another is the use of a rhetorical question in place of an argument.

### Rule #8 Reveal the journey
Besides explaining what you believe and why, tell the story of how you came to believe it.Listeners often find the prospect of changing their mind to be terrifying. They want to know where the speaker is coming from, so that they may be able to trust and even identify with the person.

### Rule #9 Name the stakeholder
Benefits and harms are rarely ends unto themselves. They are beneficial and harmful for someone. Tell the audience who that person is and why their interests are worth of consideration.

### Rule #10 Find the applause line
There are no hard-and-fast rules, but applause lines tend to be short, expressive of a complete thought, free of redundancies, original, and idealistic.

## Quiet: How to know when to disagree
### Real
There is an actual difference of option between the two sides.

### Important
The difference of options is important enough to justify a disagreement.

### Specific
The subject of the disagreement is specific enough to allow the two sides to make some progress toward resolving or ameliorating within the allotted time.

### Aligned
The two sides are aligned in their reasons for engaging in the disagreement.

## Self-defense: How to defeat a bully
### The dodger
Never respond directly to an argument but understand they must be subtle in evasion.
| Strategy   | Counter         |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Pivot      | Stay the course |
| Ad hominem |                 |
| Tu quoque  |                 |

### The Twister
Misrepresent opposing arguments. Unable or unwilling to respond to the original point, they create a distorted version of the argument (straw man) and make a show of tearing it down.

| Strategy    | Counter            |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Straw man   | correct the record |
| Burden push |                    |

### The Wrangler
Excellent at rebuttal but never put forward a positive argument of their own. Nothing is good enough for them. Their basic strategy is all attack, all the time.

| Strategy         | Counter                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Moving goalposts | pin them to a position |
| Dog whistle      |                        |

### The Liar
Liars lie. The make statements they believe to be false in order to mislead other people.

| Strategy      | Counter                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Lie           | Plug and replace           |
| Bluster       | refute representative lies |
| Liar's spread |                            |
