## 10 Ways to share your creativity and get discovered
### 1. You don't have to be a genius
- **find your scenius**: the group of people that help you to progress forward. 
- **You can’t find your voice if you don’t use it**: talk about the stuff you love.

### 2. Think process, not product.
- People like seeing how the sausage is made
- Share something every day, get into the habit of sharing?

### 3. Share something small everyday.
- Share often but not sharing everything, like your diary. Show the work.
- Use the daily share to find a pattern of what your work is, use the daily share.
- The smaller sharing everyday can amount to a large body of work.

### 4. Open up your cabinet of curiosities.
- Don't be a hoarder of information, share and invite others to the same curiosities
- "You are only good as your collection."
- Guilty pleasures is something you like. "I don't believe in guilty pleasures. If you fucking like something, like it."

### 5. Tell good stories.

### 8. Learn to take a punch.

- Each criticism is a chance to improve

### 9. Sell out.
- Making money or going through change is totally normal and expected
- There is nothing wrong with selling out, if it means it allows you to keep going and doing more of what you want to do.

### 10. Stick around.
- Keep at what you are doing
- Only if you continue the work can you succeed one day
