# How to learn

Feynman's algorithm. Can't be taught

1.  Write down the problem
2.  Think really hard
3.  Write down the solution

What is the total cost of using the wrong solution integrated over your entire career?

Developers and researchers are BOTH forced into sub-optimal solving strategies.

If you can keep a few problems in your mind and solutions around you become "genius" consultant.

Learning technique:

-   Spaced repetition
-   Depth iteration
-   Build a vocabulary
-   Walk away

"I'd rather hire a bunch of dumb mathematicians than one really smart one."

> "The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise." - Edsger W. Eijkstra

If you are using Jargon, always be willing to explain what it means. If not willing to break down abstraction you are not sharing and locking people out the details of abstraction and the meaning of the new semantic language.

If you build something, and commit to maintain it, you will not forget it.

Walk away when it stop being productive, but not when it is hard or you are distracted.

-   Bad tools and lack of knowledge cost more than you think.
-   Keep multiple pet problems and solutions.
-   Use spaced repetition;
-   Go deeper when you come back; relearn whatever you need.
-   Find or build the right vocabulary for your domain.
-   Be careful with jargon; use terminology for precision, not exclusion.
-   Don't be afraid to walk away from unproductive path
-   Don't just walk away because something is hard.
