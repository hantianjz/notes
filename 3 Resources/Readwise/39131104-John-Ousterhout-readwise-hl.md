- Isolating complexity in a place where it will never be seen is almost as good as eliminating the complexity entirely. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ht45nwcbe5rqyjbgd60yzh09))
- Sometimes an approach that requires more lines of code is actually simpler, because it reduces cognitive load. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ht45t6xn7jp7sj8f0zzysvkt))
