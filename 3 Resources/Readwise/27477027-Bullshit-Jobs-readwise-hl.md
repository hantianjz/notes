- In other words, productive jobs have, just as predicted, been largely automated away. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=108))
- In capitalism, this is precisely what is not supposed to happen. ([Location 118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=118))
- If 1 percent of the population controls most of the disposable wealth, what we call “the market” reflects what they think is useful or important, not anybody else.) ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=152))
- so to me, this is all just greed propped up by inflated prices of necessities. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=196))

- Final Working Definition: a bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=409))
- everyone is aware that human beings are not really selfish, calculating machines, assuming that they are makes it possible to explain a very large proportion of what humans do, ([Location 1525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=1525))
- exercise of powers simply for the sake of exercising them. ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=1561))
- (Schiller argued that the desire to create art is simply a manifestation of the urge to play as the exercise of freedom for its own sake as well. ([Location 1593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=1593))
- “Idle fingers knit sweaters for the devil,” ([Location 1638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=1638))
- “You’re on my time; I’m not paying you to lounge around” ([Location 1644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=1644))
- Idleness is theft. ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=1647))
- In places without clocks, time is measured by actions rather than action being measured by time. ([Location 1676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=1676))

- But it kept the paid hands “busy” and taught us proper work ethic (meaning obedience, a very high principle as taught in Mormonism), blah, blah. ([Location 1744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=1744))
- the idea that dutiful submission even to meaningless work under another’s authority is a form of moral self-discipline that makes you a better person. ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=1754))
- they do have a sense of being an autonomous entity separate from the world and from others, it is largely from conceiving themselves as capable of acting on the world and others in predictable ways. ([Location 1842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=1842))
- A bourgeois paradise will supervene, in which everyone will be free to exploit—but there will be no one to exploit. On the whole, one must suppose that the type of it would be that town that I have heard of, whose inhabitants lived by taking in each other’s washing. —William Morris, 1887 ([Location 2513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=2513))

- In a way, one could argue that the whole financial sector is a scam of sorts, since it represents itself as largely about directing investments toward profitable opportunities in commerce and industry, when, in fact, it does very little of that.

- On the individual level, why do people agree to do and put up with their own bullshit jobs? 2. On social and economic levels, what are the larger forces that have led to the proliferation of bullshit jobs? 3. On the cultural and political levels, why is the bullshitization of the economy not seen as a social problem, and why has no one done anything about it?6 ([Location 2640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=2640))
- in any political-economic system based on appropriation and distribution of goods, rather than on actually making, moving, or maintaining them, and therefore, where a substantial portion of the population is engaged in funneling resources up and down the system, that portion of the population will tend to organize itself into an elaborately ranked hierarchy of multiple tiers ([Location 3075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=3075))
- Many economic concepts trace back directly to religious ideas. As a result, arguments about value always have something of a theological tinge. ([Location 3283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RWG7YM&location=3283))
