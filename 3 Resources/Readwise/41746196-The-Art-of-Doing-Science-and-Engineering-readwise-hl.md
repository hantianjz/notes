# The Art of Doing Science and Engineering

- Education is what, when, and why to do things. Training is how to do it. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088TMLQDC&location=230))
- One answer is you must concentrate on fundamentals, at least what you think at the time are fundamentals, and also develop the ability to learn new fields of knowledge when they arise so you will not be left behind, as so many good engineers are in the long run. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088TMLQDC&location=291))
- How are you to recognize “fundamentals”? One test is they have lasted a long time. Another test is from the fundamentals all the rest of the field can be derived by using the standard methods in the field. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088TMLQDC&location=299))
- In science, if you know what you are doing, you should not be doing it. In engineering, if you do not know what you are doing, you should not be doing it. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088TMLQDC&location=301))
- The past was once the future and the future will become the past. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088TMLQDC&location=317))
- In forming your plan for your future you need to distinguish three different questions: What is possible? What is likely to happen? What is desirable to have happen? ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088TMLQDC&location=359))
- The unexamined life is not worth living. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088TMLQDC&location=394))
- It has rarely proved practical to produce exactly the same product by machines as we produced by hand. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088TMLQDC&location=447))
- We are now looking more and more in books and less and less at nature! ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088TMLQDC&location=471))
- The Buddha told his disciples, “Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.” I say the same to you—you must assume the responsibility for what you believe.
