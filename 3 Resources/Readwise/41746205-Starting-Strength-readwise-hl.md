# Starting Strength

- “good technique” in barbell training is easily and understandably defined as the ability of the lifter to keep the bar vertically aligned with the balance point. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006XJR5ZA&location=335))
- either case, a narrower grip tightens your shoulder muscles so that the bar is supported by muscle and doesn’t dig into your back. The thumbs should be placed on top of the bar so that the wrists can be held in a straight line with the forearms. ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006XJR5ZA&location=557))
- This trick is simply keeping the barbell over the mid-foot by thinking about doing so. ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006XJR5ZA&location=1233))
- an eccentric contraction occurs when the muscle lengthens under tension, and a concentric contraction occurs when the muscle shortens during tension. ([Location 2018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006XJR5ZA&location=2018))
