- 3 Forces that drive the economy
    - Productivity growth cycle
    - Short-term debt cycle
    - Long-term debt cycle
- Transactions: A economy is the sum of all transactions that make it up
    - A transaction is a buyer exchanging money/credit for good, services or, financial assets.
    - Credit spend like money
    - Total spending drives the economy
    - Total spend / Quantity sold = Price
- Market: Buyer and seller making transaction for the same thing
    - I.E. Wheat Market, Stock Market, etc...
- Central Bank is important to control the flow of credit
- Lender vs Borrower
    - Lender make more money
    - Borrower need money for something
    - Lender lend money to borrower, creating credit, and also debt
    - When interest rate is high, more expensive to borrow
    - Credit is asset to lender
    - Debt is liability to borrower
- Borrower increase spending power, creating more transactions and more total spend and drives economy
- One person's increased spending increase another's income
- A borrower can borrow money if they are credit worthy
    - They are credit worthy if they have higher income than debt
- Therefore increase income -> increased borrowing -> increased spending -> increase income in others -> others increase borrow.
- This is a CYCLE
- Productivity is important in the long run
- Debt swings 5-8 years or long term 75-100 years

- Without credit in economy, only way to increase economy is higher productivity.
- Borrowing is pulling spending forward, borrowing from future self.
- Anytime you borrow you create a cycle
- U.S. Economy have around 50 trillion dollars in credit, but only 3 trillion without it.
- Credit is bad when used to buy things that does not generate productivity, and can't be paid back
- Amount of spending and income grow faster than production, price rise (due to supply and demand curve), and cause inflation
- Central bank raise interest rate to keep inflation low
    - people borrow less -> spending less
- When inflation is lower, interest rate is low again
- Over longer term period, debt raise faster than income. This is just human nature
- Deleveraging
    - Lower spending
    - Income fall
    - Credit disappears
    - Asset price drop
- To address deleveraging
    - Cut spending, austerity, might lead to worse deleveraging
