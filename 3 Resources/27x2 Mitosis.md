- Still some pairing issue
- but first need to fix the bootloader on the dongle
    - https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/guides/short-range-guides/b/getting-started/posts/nrf52840-dongle-programming-tutorial
`./nRF5_SDK_17.1.0_ddde560/examples/dfu/open_bootloader/pca10059_usb_debug/hex/open_bootloader_usb_mbr_pca10059_debug.hex`

and it turns out was due to poor implementation of UICR erase.

- Basic sanity feature is done.
- A lot of corner cases that still needs to be ironed out mostly around the protocol stability part now
    - Still observe frequent keys drop
    - One side the board just goes out of sync
    - When the dongle is unplugged, or power cycled, both keyboard unable to reconnect.
    - I am not using gzp for pairing application on gzll protocol
- Also my nrf dongle DFU update flow is broken, I need to fix that, or somehow use jlinking, or compile the program with a bootloader?

Started by doing board layout, figure out the number of keys I want.

I wanted a keyboard with slightly tighter layout while also being ortho linear.
The keyboard needs to be wireless with dedicated rf thatâ€™s not Bluetooth/LE based for power and performance reasons.
The keyboard should be able to run QMK or any dedicated FW.
The keyboard should be low powered to live off a coin cell for few months.

In theory matrix scanning should be more power intensive since it does more scanning and using gpio interrupts.
I should test this!!!

Components:
- nrf51822 seed board
- 51 ohm resistor
- LED
- mosfet![[592FBD16-DFF0-47D4-8CB7-FE893E0C8C8D_1_102_o.jpeg]]

-  Need to figure out how to get logging

**2023-07-22**
My keyboard requirement:
- Low profile, bare pcb
- Low profile key switches
    - Choc v2 different footpoint
    - MX key compatible
- Normal keycaps for the consistent feeling
- Wireless, using 2.4GHz
- lower power using coincell battery for a few month
    - Coin cell cage
- auto power down to lowest power drain when not used

**2023-07-20**
- Okay mostly working now, which is great
- Going to start enabling and play around with other features, like tap, and layers, and key rolling
- Also need to work on timing improvement of key stroke
- pairing improvement to make connection more robust
- Start writing summary of doing FW development on nrf52 dongle

- okay finally working, shit seems to be workingish
- just need to get the proper key mapping done
```

- we are now able to send hid report now, or so I think? At least it looks like it is working
- The keyboard hid interface is coming up correctly so that"s nice?

**2023-07-16**
- bringing up a new platform for QMK
    - Timer, which is really just a clock, but it is not very clear the frequency it is expecting
    - The problem is how to test each individual part during development
- Seems like everything is hooked up fine now,
- I just need to figure out the hid report

**2023-07-15**
- There is no systick on nrf51
- RTC interrupt is not working as I expected, it is a little weird
- Also the difference between WFI and WFE is unclear to me on NRF
    - In WFI sleep the CPU will wake up as a result of an interrupt request if the associated interrupt is enabled in the NVIC. In WFE sleep the CPU will wake up as a result of an interrupt request regardless of the associated interrupt being enabled in the NVIC or not.
- Okay Keyboard FW working
- I forgot that when debugger is attached WFE always returns, hence why there is no interrupt. I should still use WFI since I depend on interrupt
- Now I need to make sure that the nrf52 dongle can add a new HID interface
- I was dumb, had used the same interface twice

- Okay the original implementation was way too interrupt driven, this all could be done with systicks or timer. Either would probably the same complexity
- It would be really nice to get GPIOTE to trigger on all port events, and I just remembered that classic GPIOTE port event bug...sigh..this is so stupid
- So We need to constantly be refreshing and reading the GPIO states while any key is pressed down, this might not be that bad?

**2023-07-12**
- Okay was able to send some data across, a uint32 of bitmap of the keys that are clicked. this seems okayish? as a starting point
- But I am running into a hardfault now, need to handle this. I suspect it is calling gazll send too often
    - Okay nevermind it went from barely hardfault to consistently hardfaulting now, need to fix this tomorrow

**2023-07-09**
- Todayâ€™s goal will be to get a polished loop back app setup for fw and maybe do a little latency test 
- Loopback some what working
    - The main lesson where is that tx can be successful without payload in ack, hence you can just move on
- *Next Step*: Keyboard FW, send sending full keys state on change

**2023-07-08**
- Today getting objcopy template working, which would require an action.py

**2023-06-07**
Okay need to figure out how to get Gazell protocol to work

- Got proof of concept working, so gazel will work with basic packet_ack example firmware
- Next step setup a decent loopback firmware for testing with some buttons and LEDs
