# Recruiter Reply Template


> [!Auto-reply]
> Hi,
> Thanks for reaching out. I’m always interested in hearing about what new and exciting opportunities are out there.
> I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I’d like to level set around the level of seniority that you’re looking for.   
> Can you send along the company name, a job description and, total compensation details for the role you’re reaching out in reference to?   
> While I very much appreciate the fact that exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters reach out consistently, sorting serious and high quality opportunities from spam would be a full time job without an autoresponder.  
> In the absence of detailed information regarding the nature of the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion.  
> Thanks again for reaching out!  
> 
> I look forward to hearing from you.

> I found a job posting for Sr Firmware Engineer on your website https://jobs.lever.co/pison/67a7fd60-306a-4020-8b17-924412becce7
> Which I assume is what you're hiring for?
> While the job looks interesting, the salary range is significantly lower from my current position, this is a non-starter for me.
> Sorry to be so blunt and direct, but I would hate to waste your time.
> 
> So unless the compensation aspect of the position can be significantly improved, I don't think there is a need for further discussion.
> 
> Thanks.
