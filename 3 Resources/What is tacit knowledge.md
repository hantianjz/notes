# What is tacit knowledge
> [!quote] 
> Tacit knowledge or implicit knowledge - as opposed to formal, codified or explicit knowledge - is knowledge that is difficult to express or extract, and thus more difficult to transfer to others by means of writing it down or verbalizing it. This can include personal wisdom, experience, insight, and intuition.

It's the skill or wisdom or experience that can't be easily transferred from one to another.

It is much more valuable to share specific experience or watch people actually working. As opposed to writing general principles.
