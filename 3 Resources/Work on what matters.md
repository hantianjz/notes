## Avoid snacking
Avoid doing too much low effort low impact work.

## Stop preening
High-visibility work and high-impact work are often conflated. The two are often not the same thing.

## Stop chasing ghosts
High effort low impact work

## Existential issues

## Work where there's room _and_ attention
The work that everyone is working on might not be the most effective task to have meaningful impact.

The most effective places to work are those that matter to your company but still have enough room to actually do work.

Sometimes you'll find work that's _worthy_ of attention but which an organization is incapable of paying attention to, usually because its *leadership doesn't value that work*. In some companies, this is *developer tooling work*. In others, it's *inclusion work*. In most companies, it's [***glue work***](https://noidea.dog/glue).

## Foster growth
- optimizing the [hiring funnel](https://lethain.com/hiring-funnel/)
- onboarding
- mentoring
- coaching

## Edit
Find the smallest change to a system that will progress it further.

## Finish things
We [only get value from finishing projects](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078Y98RG8/), and getting a project over the finish line is the magical moment it goes from risk to leverage. Time spent getting work finished is always time well spent.

## What only you can
The sort of work that simply won't happen if you don't do it.

Whatever it is, things that simply won't happen if you don't do them are your biggest opportunity to work on something that matters, and it's a category that will get both narrower and deeper the further you get into your career.
