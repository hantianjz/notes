# How to ask for help
I believe asking for help can be art, it is something one should put some thoughts into.

We all have those people in our lives, can't seem to do anything themselves, constantly seeking help and require hand holding every step of the way. On the other end of spectrum,  some folks rarely seek help, even when they actually need it, bottling up everything inside and occasionally making the problem worse. Both end of spectrum generally undesirable.
