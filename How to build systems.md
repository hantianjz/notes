# How to build systems

1. Set a goal
2. Form a strategy 
    - What worked for you in the past
    - What worked for others in the past
3. Take the one time actions first
    - What can I spend money to solve 
    - What can I change my environmental 
    - What can I eliminate 
    - How to join group of people that solved these problems 
4. Create a system for daily or weekly actions 
5. Commit to action 
    - 10/30/100 rules
    - 10 days to check if sustainable, if canâ€™t do find something else to do
    - 30 (after 40 days total) days to verify progress, if not try something else
    - 100 days (140 days total) 90% commitment
