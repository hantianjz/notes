# Bullshit Jobs: A Theory

Definition of a Bullshit job:
> [!quote]
A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.

> [!quote]
If 1 percent of the population controls most of the disposable wealth, what we call "the market" reflects what _they_ think is useful or important, not anybody else.

> [!quote]
As Socrates teaches us, when this happens--when our own definitions produce results that seem intuitively wrong to us--it's because we're not not ware of what we really think.
[capitalism] was really a political project dressed up as an economic one.

The bullshitization of the economy has only just begun.

> [!quote]
The answer clearly isn't economic: it's moral and political. The ruling class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger. (Think of what started to happen when this even began to be approximated in the sixties.) And, on the other hand, the feeling that work is a moral value in itself, and that anyone not willing to submit themselves to some kind of intense work discipline for most of their waking hours deserves nothing, is extraordinarily convenient for them.

Hell is a collection of individuals who are spending the bulk of their time working on a task they don't like and not especially good at.

- More than half of American offices are spend on bullshit, and the problem is getting worse.
- The real jobs that is created to support the bullshit jobs. The second order effect of bullshit jobs.

## Flunkies
- People with minor task as an excuse to hang around and make another look impressive. Maybe a way to manage the excess population.
- Example:
  - Building concierge, for opening front doors and saying hello to resident.
  - Or uniform elevator operator
  - receptionist, because it is the social norm
  - broker's cold caller to make broker look important. A social status symbol.
  - Office administrator, often doing most of the non-bullshit work in an office
  - "If you didn't have underlings, you couldn't really claim to be noble."
  - "For without flunkies, to whom, exactly, would they be 'superior'"?
## Goons
- People whose job exist because other people employ them.
- Arm, lobbyists, PR specialists, telemarketers, corporate lawyers.
- Goons find their jobs objectionable...essentially manipulative and aggressive.
- Supply far outpaced demand, so demand is manufactured and usefulness exaggerated.
- Honest illusion and dishonest one. Honest illusion is where viewer know it is an illusion and play along like stage magicians. Where as Photoshop selfie promote false sense beauty.
## Duct tapers
- SRE? Jobs created to deal with glitch or fault in the organization
- Housewife's neurosis: A condition from women forced to clean up after other, become fanatical about domestic hygiene.
- A whole genre of jobs involved to correcting damage done by someone higher on the totem pole.
## Box tickers
- Allow an organization to claim it is doing something where in fact it is not doing.
- Box ticking exercise actually undermine the original purpose.
- corporate compliance
## Taskmasters
- Assigning work to others, opposite of flunkies.
- Or create bullshit task for people to do, or supervise bullshit task
- "The entire job of middle management is to ensure that lower-level people hit their 'productivity number'"
- Supervise people who don't need supervision.
- Setting up quantifiable methods to assessing performance.
- The real roles of power and responsibility trace through flow of money, without real power, executives are just left with "the power of persuasion and influence".

## Second order bullshit jobs
- jobs that in itself is not pointless or bullshit, but is meant to serve bullshit jobs
  - Security guard
  - Cleaners for people too busy with bullshit jobs
  - Food delivery

Unable to make sense or tell a story to themselves about the nature of their situation, or what is wrong about it.

> Moral confusion.

We assume human beings will always tend to seek their best advantage. To find themselves a situation where they can get the most benefit fro the least expenditure of time and effort.

It is also a matter of their background and how they make sense of the bullshitness of the situation and make the best of it. 

It is not just the purposelessness of the situation, but also the falseness. "Telemarketer forced by their employer to scam people." The naked emperor, where everyone can see, but also knows to not mention it.

If we assume minimax (minimize cost, maximize benefit) where correct, people should be happy to be paid to do nothing. With this model, it is derived that "People have to be compelled to work;" If humans are offered the option to be parasites, of course they'll take it.

In prisons, prisoners prefer labor rather than doing nothing.

"**The pleasure at being the cause**," Baby express extraordinary happiness when they first figure out they can cause predictable effects in the world. May be the reason why human tend to seek power. 

Our [[sense of self]] is built on top of our action.

If children has discover and experienced **the pleasure at being the cause**, and then suddenly denied of it. The child will rage, refusal to engage, and catatonic folding in on oneself and withdrawing from the world entirely. **"Trauma of failed influence"**

From that, bullshit jobs are an assault on the person's sense of self-importance, and more importantly a direct attack on the sense that one even *is a [[self]]*.

We wish to exercise our power as an end in themselves. - [[Karl Groos]]

This is all that [[freedom]] is. Exercise of freedom for its own sake. - [[Friedrich Schiller]]

Bosses make-work to exercise their power/freedom. Bullshit job workers being forced to work for the sake of working is an indignity. It is the lack of freedom like slave and prisoners.

>Men tend to try, and usually succeed, to monopolize the most exiting, dramatic kinds of work. Men will always take for themselves the kind of jobs one can tell stories about afterwards.
>While women are often assigned more monotonous and time-consuming tasks, such as weeding.

The same pattern often reproduce itself, whenever one group is in a position of power over another. 

''You're on my time; I'm not paying you to lounge around", where work's idleness is theft from employer.

In places without clocks, time is measured by actions rather than action being measured by time.

Bullshit jobs require certain level of emotional labor, similar to those required in the service industry, but also different. The game is played without explicit indication of what the rule is, or why it is being played, or who is on your team.

"Scriptlessness", lack of cultural models. Where there isn't any culture example of bullshit jobs. (Well I think the "Office" might be a good example nowadays)

> ... much of our sense of being a self, a being discrete from its surrounding environment. This is true for infants and remains true throughout life. 

The very meaninglessness of bullshit employment tends to exacerbate the sadomasochistic dynamic. The lack of feeling of a common purpose, any reason to believe one's collective action in any way make life better for those outside the office, or have any significant effect on anyone outside the office, will tend to magnify the minor indignities, dis-tempers, resentments, and cruelties of office life, since ultimately, office politics is all that's really going on.

Bull-shit jobs regularly induce feelings of hopelessness, depression, and self-loathing. They are forms of spiritual violence directed atthe essence of what it means to be a human being.

In a way, one could argue that the whole financial sector is a scam of sorts, since it represents itself as largely about directing investments toward profitable opportunities in commerce and industry, where, in fact, it does very little of that. The overwhelming bulk of its profits comes from colluding with government to create, and then to trade and manipulate, varrious formsof debt.

1. Individual level of cause to the problem.
2. Structure level of cause to the problem.
3. Social or culture or political level of cause to the problem.

In any political-economic system based on appropriation and distribution of goos, rather than on actually making, moving, or maintaining them, and therefore, where a su;bstantial portion of the population is engaged in funnelingresourcesup and down the system, that portion of the population will tend to organize itself into an elabrattely ranked hierarchy of multiple tiers (Atleastthree,and sometimes ten...).

This set off a vicious cycle whereby workers, who no longer felt any loyalty to corporations that felt none toward them, had t obe increasingly monitored, managed, and surveilled.

> [!quote] 
If the existence of bullshit jobs seems to defy the logic of capitalism, one possible reason for their proliferation might be that the existing system _isn't_ capitalism-or at least, isn't any sort of capitalism that would be recognizable from the works of Adam Smith, Karl Marx, or, for that matter, Ludwig von Mises or Milton Friedman.
It is increasingly a system of rent extraction where the internal logic are profoundly differnt from capitalism, since economic and political imperatives have come to largely merge.
In manyways, it resembles classic medieval feudalism, displaying the same tendency to create endliess hierarchies of lords, vassals, and retainers.

>Many economic concepts trace back directly to religious ideas. As a result, arguments about value always have something of a theological tinge. 

> [!quote] 
In public debate, all work must be treated as sacred duty, and therefore any work is always preferable to none at all.

> [!quote] 
We can't really discuss any of these things in terms of a language of "needs." To a large degree, needsare just other people's expectations. Most economists conclude therefore that there's no point in sitting in judgment about what people _should_ want; better to just accept that they _do_ want, and then sit in judgment about how effectively they set about pursuing their desires.
   
> [!quote] 
The labor theory of value assume that the real value of a commodity is that work that has been inbestedin making its existance possible. So when we give money in exchange for a loadof bread, what we are really paying for is the human effort that wentinto growing the wheat, baking the bread, and packing and transporting the loaves. If you are defrauding others of their wealth, you are really stealing the real, productive work that went into creating that wealth.

> [!quote] 
...all value come from work, is not the same thing as saying that all work produces value.

- Since there is no way to subjectively justify what work produce value, and what NOT. The prevailing view among economists is that if there is a market for a given good or service, then it's clearly valuable to someone and that is its value.
 - The market can't be always right, since bullshit jobs do exist.
