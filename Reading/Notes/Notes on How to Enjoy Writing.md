# How to Enjoy Writing - A book of aid and comfort

## Introduction
 > [!Logan Pearsall Smith] 
 >  The test of a vocation is that love of the drudgery it involves.
 
 > [!Rummer Godden]
 > I have never understood why “hard work” is suppose to be pitiable. True, some work is soul-destroying when it is done against the grain, but when it is part of a “making” how can you grudge it? You get tired, of course, often in despair, but the struggle, the challenge, the feeling of being extended as you never thought you could be is fulfilling and deeply, deeply statisfying.
 
 ## The Fun Of It

Any activity is enjoyable if:
1. You do it well.
2. You think it’s worth doing.
3. You feel good while doing it (Physically, emotionally, and mentally)
4. It helps others (This include entertaining them).
5. It makes money.
6. It brings you positive response.
(p3)

All constructive work is creative work, while destructive work is never creative. (p4)

## The Work
### Language the basic tool
The main rule of writing is: Either it sounds right or it doesn’t sound right. You have spend a lifetime reading, you should know. (p6)

Read Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, and P.G. Wodehouse. Understand for your self why they do it, use the words, sentences and paragraphs. (p9)

### Using language
- Be simple and clear. At least start with, marshal thoughts into words people can understand.
- Think it through first. 
- Have faith in your mind. Your mind will come up with creative way to the problem.
(p10)

Everything is deep and meaningful is you look hard enough. (p12)

Get the music right and grammar will automatically be correct and word order proper and though clear. (p12)

Just sit down and write. (p14)

> [!Dickens]
> With all my heart to do well … thorough-going, ardent, and sincere earnestness … never to put one hand to anything on which I could throw my whole self; and never to affect depreciation of my work, whatever it was.
(p14)

### Language and Style
Four main technical point about writing:
1. Use strong words - Mostly nouns and verbs - not weak.
2. When in doubt, leave it out (especially adjectives and adverbs)
3. Show, don’t tell.
4. Plant it now, dig it later.
(p16)

Where short and simple constructions make the point, they must be used. (p16)

The object of all writing is to get the reader to turn the page. (p20)

There is a great deal of art to creating something that seems artless. (p22)

Reality = Unpredictability = Uncertainty
==> Reality = Change
(p26)

## Coping II

- Stay fit
- Be organized
- Simplify life
- Don’t try to be a perfectionist
(p33-35)

## Coping III 
Try to dread only one day at a time. (p45)

Maturity, self-awareness, and peace of mind free you to be creative. (p46)

Attitude is all. (p47)

*Life is a journey, but don’t worry, you’ll find a parking place at the end.* - Isaac (p50)

## What writers go through

Yet among all these evils I seem to live so sweetly, that may I die if I would change places with Persian King. -Johann Joachim Becher (p69)

I know all the miseries, but somewhere among them is happiness. I can’t easily explain where it is or what it consists of, but it is there. (p69)

## Words vs Pictures
When a story, with its plot and its characters< appears in more than one form, you tend to be imprinted by the first-form in which you experience it. (p80)

Books are a series of words. They are altogether language. (p82)

Writer can aim to please fewer than one out of every thousand Americans. For their book to be successful. (p83)

A reader reading book is not just the product of the author alone, but the production of the interaction of the author and each of the readers separately. What, then, can replace a book? (p93)

On why are not more people reading. Not everyone, in fact darned few, are ready to give what is demanded, so they don’t read, and they won’t ready. (p94)

## Bright Future: Writing Non-Fiction
The information itself remains on the form it was in prehistoric times: speech, and the frozen symbology of speech that we call writing. (p101)

It will be the writer, using words (with the aid of illustrations where that can make the explanation simpler or raise the interest higher, but primarily using words), who will endeavor to translate the specialized vocabulary of science and technology into ordinary English.
No one suggests that writing about science will turn the entire world into an intelligent audience, that writers will mold the average person into a model of judgment and creative thought. It will be enough if they spread the knowledge as widely as possible; if some millions, who would otherwise be ignorant (or, worse, swayed by meaningless slogans), would as a result, gain some understanding; if those whose options are most likely to be turned into action, such as the political and economic rulers of the world, are educated.
(p104)

History was a race between education and catastrophe. (p104)

## Imagination: The joys of writing fiction

Writers write. The act of imagining is somehow completed when put into words and shared with others. (p109)

## A last plea: Write what makes people feel better
So much writing exist that make people feel worse. The brutality, the defeatism, the unpleasant, and the repulsive of the world. It is certainly easy and less work to write, dispose of all loose ends by carefully thinking the worst. Writer should not try to exploit and augment the human tendency to “fall into helplessness”. 
(p149)

>[! Isaac]
>Violence is the last refuge of the inompetent.

> [!Joseph Wood Krutch]
> If love and Honor and Duty can be salvaged, then someone must write about them in a fashion which carries conviction. If we are to get alone without them, then someone must describe a world from which they are absent in a fashion which makes that world seems worth having. And it is just the failure to do either of these things quite adequately which reveals the weakness of contemporary literature.

(p149)

## Meditation for writers
I know who I am. I’m a member of the animal kingdom, *phylum chordata, subphylum vertebrata, class mammalia, order primate* - closely related to chimpanzees and gorillas, with whom we can now talk.
I’m of the family Homididae, genus homo, species homo sapiens sapiens. I’ll try not to forget that we named ourselves (doubly) sapiens, the most intelligent species. Nobody else calls us that.
And I know where I am - On the third planet of a solar system in the Milky Way galaxy in a huge universe becomes conscious of itself and able to create beauty and meaning.
I am a living part of the universe but apart, because I’m self-aware. I share this aloneness with all human beings, isolated within the three pounds of gray brain inside out skulls.
But we can communicate.
And I will do the best I can.
(p151)

## The writer’s working library for aid and comfort
- Bartlett’s familiar quotations
- World almanac
- An almanac of words at play

Life is short and word processors have a way of looking hungry…(p155)
