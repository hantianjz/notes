# Notes on The Staff Engineer's Path
A guide for individual contributors navigating growth and change.

## Pillars of staff engineer
- Big-picture thinking
- Execution
- Leveling up

## What would you say you do here?
In ideal world every company have set of team the correspond to exactly the product/company desired architecture. All team communicate well, therefore you wouldn't really need staff engineers.
But reality is not like that. One way to keep a mismatch of teams together and keep forward progress is to have someone own the whole thing rather than any of its individual parts.
Staff engineer can influence individual teams to be better. Be the role model.

The more senior you become, the more you will rely on communication. Almost everything you do will involve conveying information from your brain to other people's brains and vice versa.

Staff engineers are:
- Technical
- Autonomous
- Sets technical direction
- Communicates

> If your manager doesn't have access to some piece of information, you almost certainly won't either.

A too broad scope for staff engineer leads to:
- Becoming bottleneck
- Decision fatigue
- Missing relationships

A too narrow scope for staff engineer leads to:
- Lack of impact
- Opportunity cost
- Overshadowing other engineers
- Over-engineering (Cause of boredom)

- Be clear about the scope of the job.

Core disciplines of any job:
- Core technical skills
- Product management
- Project management
- People management

- Various [[What is the Staff Engineer archetypes|archetypes]] for staff engineers.

- Choose project that will benefit from your attention.

- Align on scope, shade and primary focus.

TODO: Understand your *reporting chain, scope, work preference*

## Three Maps

### A locator map: You are here

### A topographical map: Learning the terrain

#### Attributes of culture
- Secrete or Open
    - How freely is the information shared
- Oral or Written
    - How is the information shared in words or orally
- Top-down or bottom-up
- Fast or deliberate change
    - Move fast and break things? Or design doc everything?
- Back channels or front doors
    - How does different teams talk to each other, engineers to engineers directly, or every task goes through the manager
- Allocated or available
    - How are team's time and task assigned/created
- Liquid or Crystallized
    - How often does the power structure change, and how freely does it change?
    - Startup vs established org

#### Typology of Organizational Cultures
- Power, rules or mission
    - Pathological
        - Low co-operation
    - Bureaucratic
        - Rule-oriented
    - Generative
        - Mission-oriented, high-trust, high-cooperation

| Pathological | Bureaucratic | Generative |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| Power-oriented|Rule-Oriented|Performance-oriented|

- A feeling for how much people will share information, cooperate, take the time to help and get behind new ideas will keep you safer and less frustrated as you cross the terrain.
- If in bureaucracy organization
    - Plan ahead
    - Stay within the rules
    - Respect chain of command
- If in pathological organization
    - stake fewer risks, cover your ass when do take risks

#### Point of interests
- Chasms: Gaps between groups of people make communication and decision making difficult. Grouping by cultures, norms, goals, and expectations.
- Fortresses: 
    - Team, or individual stop anyone getting project done. Blockers for your progress.
    - Can be quality gatekeeper that keep up the quality
    - May need sponsorship from someone gatekeeper respects, or password for the bridge (Address their concerns)
- Disputed territory
    - Area of project that ownership is unclear and muddy
- Uncrossable deserts
    - Previously attempted challenge that most people have give up on and see as can't be done
    - Be careful to attempt those
- Paved roads, shortcuts, and long way around
    - The established norms and process
    - well tread trails

The POI you include says something about you as well, note what is at center and what side you are taking.

#### How are decisions made
Organization have different decision making process.
> [!Out of loop]
> If you consistently feel out of loop, that's a sign that you don't understand how decisions are made and who influences them.

- Find the **room** *where* the decision is made, *what* format is the **room**, and *who* is in it.
- Ask to join the room, with the value you can bring by letting you join
    - Also need to reduce the cost on others for including you
        - Show up prepared
        - Speak concisely
- Be realistic about the effect of the room

#### Shadow org chart
- Observe the chain of soft influence in the org

#### How to keep up the info
- Automated announcement lists and channels
- Walking the floor
- Lurking
- Making time for reading
- Checking in with your leadership
- talking to people

Become a bridge if there are un-navigable terrains

### A treasure map: X marks the spot
Without a overall goal or roadmap it is:
- It'll be harder to keep everyone going in the same direction
- You won't finish big things
- You'll accumulate cruft
- You'll have competing initiatives
- Engineers stop growing: Won't be able to tell a story of why they did that they did.

- Be clear about what goals everyone is aiming for.
- Think about your own work and what your journey is.
