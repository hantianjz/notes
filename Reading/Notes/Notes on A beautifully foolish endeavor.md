# A beautifully foolish endeavor
- We are not safe and our reality is broken 

> Like, imagine what would happen to the gun control debate if every gun just wiped out of existence along with the knowledge of... what guns are or how to make them. The thing we were all so mad at each other over was just gone.
> “What does great mean to you?” “It means something better than good. So good it improves the lives of more people than I will ever hope to meet.”
> “But for some people, great just means big, and if it’s big enough, they’ll convince themselves either that it’s good or that it’s inevitable, so it might as well be their names that get into the history books”
> “I can smell that kind of ambition. It’s not about making the world better, it’s about using marvelous potential and intelligence to feel like they matter. I won’t work with people like that, because if they don’t think they matter despite being some of the most successful, important, influential people on earth, what most they think of the rest of us?”
