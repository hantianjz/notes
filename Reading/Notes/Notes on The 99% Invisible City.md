# Notes on The 99% Invisible City

## Official Graffiti - Utility Codes

Any construction project that dig into the ground could potentially hit cables and pipes underground causing everything from major utility outage to gas leaks.
June 1976, LA California workers excavating on Venice Boulevard cut into hidden petroleum pipeline, causing pipe rupture and gases ignited into a fireball. More than 2 dozen people killed or injured.
A nonprofit, DigAlert, was created to solve this problem in southern California.
Now, a uniform Color Codes developed by the American Public Works Association:
- **Red**: Electric power lines, cables, and conduit
- **Orange**: telecommunications, alarms and signal lines
- **Yellow**: Gaseous or combustive materials. (Natural gas, oil, petroleum, and steam)
- **Green**: sewers and drain lines
- **Blue**: potable water
- **Purple**: reclaimed water, irrigation, or slurry lines
- **Pink**: Temporary markings, unidentified facilities, or known unknowns
- **White**: Proposed excavation areas, limits, or routes

## Initialed Impressions - Sidewalk Markings
Metal plaques embedded in sidewalks with message like:
- "Space within building lines not dedicated"
- "Property behind this plaque not dedicated"

In property law, dedicating means giving over to another party - the public. 

Easement laws allow people limited right to cross people's land, but also different forms of adverse possession. If someone uses a piece of property "blatantly, consistently and exclusively for a long, statutorily set amount of time -21 years in Pennsylvania- then they own it." If private owner fail to explicitly mark out their territory, someone could argue they have forfeited ownership.

## Planned Failure - breakaway Posts
Posts that holds up sign, street lights and utility lines needs to be strong and durable to withstand weather, but break easily on impact.
A slip base system allow post to break properly, where the post is attached to a base using breakaway bolts.

## A little Safer - Emergency Boxes
Knox Boxes, a common brand of lock key boxes for emergency service to access buildings in case of emergency.

## Thornton's Scent Bottle - Stink Pipes
Sydney's Hyde Park in Australia's oldest park.
A grand 27 foot tall monument used as ventilation for sewer, inspired by Cleopatra's Needles.
2 type of sewer vent: educt and induct.
induct drew in air, educt expel lighter air out.

## Exhaustive Outlets - Fake Facades
Face house facades that is really exhaust outlet for the underground.

## Neighborhood Transformers - Electrical Substations

Built residential looking substations in neighborhoods to be aesthetically pleasing and fit into nearby neighborhood.

## Cellular Biology - Wireless Towers

Single monopole disguised as pine tree called Mono-Pine.

## Resourceful Artifice - Production Wells
In The 1890s, what was then a small town of around fifty thousand people became the center of an energy boom. By 1930, California was responsible for a quarter of the world's oil output.
