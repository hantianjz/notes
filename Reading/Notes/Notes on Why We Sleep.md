## Suprachiasmatic (*Soo-pra-kai-as-MAT-il*) nucleus.
Biological twenty-four-hour clock in our brain.

## Chronotype
"Morning Lark" make up 40% of population
"Night Owls" approximately 30%
"Other" 30% in between

## Adenosine
Adenosine accumulate every minute awake
Caffeines blocks adenosine's neuron receptor, does not get rid of Adenosine.
Caffeine crash is sudden when caffeine is out of system and adenosine flood to neuron receptors.

## Sleep pressure
Sleep drive (Process-S) help to pressure the body to go to sleep.
Circadian Wake drive (Process-C) help to pressure the body to be awake.
The two drive fluctuate independently.

## REM (Rapid Eye Movement)
During REM sleep, the memories are being replayed far more slowly; at just half or quarter the speed.
NREM (Non-rapid Eye Movement)
Cycles every **90** minutes

NREM sleep is one of the most epic displays of neural collaboration. Many thousands of brain cells unite and "sing", or fire, at the same time.

This stunning electrical harmony, ripples across surface of brain hundreds of times each night. Starts below the surface of the brain, within the thalamus. The thalamus-the sensory gate, seated deep in the middle of the brain-blocks the transfer of perceptual signals (sound, sight, touch, etc.) up to the top of the brain, or the cortex. By severing perceptual ties with the outside world, not only do we lose our sense of consciousness (explaining why we do not dream in deep NREM sleep, nor do we keep explicit track of time), this allows the cortex to "relax" into its default mode of functioning. That default mode is what we call deep slow-wave sleep. It is an active, deliberate, but highly synchronous state of brain activity. It is a near state of nocturnal cerebral meditation, though it is very different from the brainwave activity of waking meditative states.

## Sleeping in Animals (Chap 4)
Duration of sleep is different amount every animal, and duration is not dependent on any single factor of the animal.
Weakly correlated to body size and brain size ratio.
Maybe due to quality of sleep instead of time of sleep. 
Sleep likely shaped by numerous forces along the evolutionary path.

All species experiences NREM sleep. Insects, amphibians, fish, and most reptiles do not REM sleep.

All mammals have REM sleep. Except aquatic mammals, where it is uncertain.

Pinnipeds (such as fur seals). REM sleep when on land, NO REM when in water.

Birds and Human evolved separately, but bird also REM sleep. Which suggest REM sleep was birthed twice in evolution, from the same evolution pressure, suggest a fundamental need.

NREM sleep first to appear in evolution.

After sleep deprived day, the first sleep night NREM sleep rebounds harder. On second, third or forth night, REM sleep become primary portion of sleep.

Sleep can never catch up with more sleep.

*Dolphin* brain can uncouple when sleep. One side remain awake while the other side sleep. Sleep is so important that, that evolution rather invent convoluted split-shit brain system then to avoid sleep.

Bird also sleep with uncoupled brain, where one eye is working to look out for danger. Bird when sleeping in a group line up side by side in a row, the birds in the middle of row sleep with both brain. The ones on the both end sleep with half side brain.

## Sleeping in Human (p71)
Human when in unfamiliar sleep environments, half of the brain sleep lighter than the other half. REM sleep is full brain, and never split brain.

*Monophasic* sleep pattern. Single period of sleep in a day.
*Biphasic* sleep pattern. 2 period of sleep, nap in the afternoon.

Western Europeans used to practise Biphasic sleep.

Homo Erectus first to use fire, allowed them to sleep on the ground. Which also allowed longer REM sleep period which required body to be limp and unresponsive. Unlike monkey/gorilla sleeping on tree, which can't go into REM as easy.

Longer REM sleep enabled our degree of sociocultural complexity, and cognitive intelligence. 

## Sleep across the life span (chap 5)
While in utterers, most of time spent in sleep. 6 hour of REM, 6 hour of NREM, 12 hours intermediary sleep state.
Week before birth, REM sleep hits lifetime high of **12 hours**.

Infant, and young with signs of autism, do not have normal sleep patterns, or duration.

Alcohol suppress REM sleep. Pregnant mother that drink alcohol directly effect the baby.

Goal of adolescent development is transition from parental dependence to independence, while learning navigate complex peer group relationships and interactions.
Adolescent have a later circadian pattern, compare to their parent, to help learn how to operate independently for several hours every day.

As we get older, sleep become less efficient hence more forgettable, and more prone to dementia.

## Why we sleep (chap 6)
Sleep help us forget, interference forgetting. Sleeping the night before learning help clear the short term memory for new information storage.
Help us to move memory from short term memory storage to longe term.

## Sleep deprivation on mind (chap 7)
Drowsy-driving accidents is momentary lapse in concentration, micro-sleep.

One night no sleep, micro-sleep spike by 400%.
4 hours sleep for 6 nights, is similar to 1 night no sleep.
6 hours sleep for 10 days, is also similar to 1 night no sleep.

You don't know when you are sleep deprived.

"Power Nap" take naps early before [[sleep deprivation]] set in help alleviate harm when needed to sleep awake for long periods. Prevention VS treatment.

**[[Amygdala]]** is our emotion center. It become excessive reactive without sleep. The **[[prefrontal cortex]]** control our emotion. Without sleep the **prefrontal cortex** lose strong coupling with **amygdala**.
Without sleep, we experience extreme mood swings. The **striatum**, associated with impulsivity and reward, become hyperactive in sleep deprived.

There is **NO** major psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal.

> The best bridge between despair and hope is a good night's sleep

**hippocampus** store short term memory. Sleep deprivation shutdown the [[hippocampus]] preventing new information being stored.
Similarly if sleep deprived after a long study session, the learning does not get stored to long term memory. Sleep memory consolidation is an all-or-nothing event.

**Alzheimer's Disease** identified in 1901 by German physician Dr. Aloysius [[Alzheimer]].
Alzheimer patients have very poor sleep, making it a negative spiral that can initiate and/or accelerate the condition.
Alzheimer's Disease is associated with the buildup of toxic form of protein called **beta-amyloid**. Sleep impairment cause [[Amyloid]] protein build up, more amyloid build up the worse the deep NREM sleep.
Dr. Maiken Nedergaard found "sewage network" of brain glymphatic system made up of glia cell. Glial cells are distributed throughout your entire brain, situated side by side with the neurons. Just like the lymphatic system, glymphatic system collects and removes dangerous metabolic contaminants generated by neurons. System work mostly during NREM sleep. Glial cells shrink in size by 60% during NREM sleep, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to clean up metabolic contaminants. And amyloid protein is one of the contaminants cleaned up by glymphatic system, and various other elements.

[[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] both very vocal and proud about sleeping only four to five hours a night. And all developed Alzheimer's disease later in life.

## Sleep deprivation on body (chap 8)
Atherosclerosis cause coronary artery blockage.

The sympathetic nervous system is resolutely activating, inciting, even agitating. Deficient sleep lead to overactive sympathetic nervous system. Leading to more inflammation. 
Higher cortisol stress hormone.
Endothelium, growth hormone to replenish lining of blood vessels, and fix fracturing vessels. which is suppressed by lack of sleep.

[[diabetes]] is $375 billion a year.

Leptin: Signals feeling of full.
Ghrelin: Signals feeling of hunger.

Less sleep damage capstone telomeres of individual's chromosomes.

## REM sleep
REM sleep is like being psychotic:
-Hallucinating
-Delusional
-Disoriented
-Affectively labile (easily altered)
-Amnesia

4 area of spike in brain when in REM sleep:
1. visuospatial region at back of the brain
2. motor cortex
3. hippocampus, support autobiographical memory
4. Amygdala and cingulate cortex, deep emotional centers of the brain. 30% more active in REM sleep compared when awake.

Freud's theory can't be proven true of false, will always be abandoned by science. 

**Epiphenomena**: The side effect of something else. I.E. "Heat emitted from a lightbulb is epiphenomenon."

**Noradrenaline (norepinephrine)**, a key stress-related chemical is completely shutoff while in REM sleep only. Brain equivalent of adrenaline.

## IPads, Factory whistles, and Nightcaps

The visible light spectrum - which our eye can see - runs the gamut from shorter wavelengths (~380 nm)  that we perceive as cooler violets and blues to the longer wavelengths (~700nm) that we sense as warmer yellows and reds.

## General good sleep practices
Going to bed and waking up at the same time of day no matter what.

## Appendix: 12 tips for healthy sleep
https://medlineplus.gov/healthysleep.html

To improve your sleep habits, it also may help to:
-   Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day
-   Avoid [caffeine](https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html), especially in the afternoon and evening
-   Avoid nicotine
-   [Exercise](https://medlineplus.gov/exerciseandphysicalfitness.html) regularly, but don't exercise too late in the day
-   Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed
-   Avoid large meals and beverages late at night
-   Don't take a nap after 3 p.m.
-   Relax before bed, for example by taking a bath, reading or listening to relaxing music
-   Keep the temperature in your bedroom cool
-   Get rid of distractions such as noises, bright lights, and a TV or computer in the bedroom. Also, don't be tempted to go on your phone or tablet just before bed.
-   Get enough sunlight exposure during the day
-   Don't lie in bed awake; if you can't sleep for 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing
-   See a doctor if you have continued trouble sleeping. You may have a [sleep disorder](https://medlineplus.gov/sleepdisorders.html), such as [insomnia](https://medlineplus.gov/insomnia.html) or [sleep apnea](https://medlineplus.gov/sleepapnea.html). In some cases, your doctor may suggest trying over-the-counter or prescription sleep aid. In other cases, your doctor may want you to do a sleep study, to help diagnose the problem.

If you are a shift worker, it can be even harder to get a good sleep. You may also want to:

-   Take naps and increase the amount of time available for sleep
-   Keep the lights bright at work
-   Limit shift changes so your body clock can adjust
-   Limit caffeine use to the first part of your shift
-   Remove sound and light distractions in your bedroom during daytime sleep (for example, use light-blocking curtains)
