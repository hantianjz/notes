# On distraction and social media addiction

Book: Indistractable

>  90% of the time when we get distracted, it’s the result of _internal_ triggers such as boredom, loneliness, uncertainty, and fatigue. In Nir’s words, “The reason we get distracted is because we are looking to escape an uncomfortable emotional sensation.” You could have an iPhone on your desk or a rock—either way, if you’re dreading the task ahead, you’ll probably start fiddling with it.

At one point meditation really helped me to focus and catch myself when I am looking for that distraction.
Need to build that trigger of catching myself at moment of boredom, and override my habit/default action.

time management is pain management.

Distraction vs traction

Tantalus’s curse was his blindness to the fact he didn’t need those things in the first place. That’s the real moral of the story.

Epicurus, the ancient Greek philosopher, said it best: “By pleasure, we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul.”

distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality.

To harness its power, we must disavow the misguided idea that if we’re not happy, we’re not normal—exactly the opposite is true.

Acceptance and commitment (act)
- STEP 1: LOOK FOR THE DISCOMFORT THAT PRECEDES THE DISTRACTION, FOCUSING IN ON THE INTERNAL TRIGGER
- STEP 2: WRITE DOWN THE TRIGGER
- STEP 3: EXPLORE YOUR SENSATIONS
- STEP 4: BEWARE OF LIMINAL MOMENTS

By reimagining an uncomfortable internal trigger, we can disarm it. 
- Step 1. Look for the emotion preceding distraction.
- Step 2. Write down the internal trigger.
- Step 3. Explore the negative sensation with curiosity instead of contempt. 
- Step 4. Be extra cautious during liminal moments.

Operating under constraints is the key to creativity and fun.

“The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.”

Fun is looking for the variability in something other people don’t notice. It’s breaking through the boredom and monotony to discover its hidden beauty.

Self-compassion makes people more resilient to letdowns by breaking the vicious cycle of stress that often accompanies failure.

values are “how we want to be, what we want to stand for, and how we want to relate to the world around us.”

- You can’t call something a distraction unless you know what it is distracting you from. Planning ahead is the only way to know the difference between traction and distraction.
- Does your calendar reflect your values? To be the person you want to be, you have to make time to live your values.
- Time box your day. The three life domains of you, relationships, and work provide a framework for planning how to spend your time.
- Reflect and refine. Revise your schedule regularly, but you must commit to it once it’s set.

I won’t do what I want to do if I’m not in the right place at the right time, whether that’s in bed when I want to sleep or at my desk when I want to do good work. Not showing up guarantees failure.

You can’t always control what you get out of time you spend, but you can control how much time you put into a task. This is like writing everyday

Schedule time for family and friends

Set clear time box at work

Syncing your schedule with stakeholders at work is critical for making time for traction in your day.

Psychological safety is the antidote to the depression-inducing work environments.

the so-called sugar high is a myth for kids, it does have a real effect on parents.

“Each successive historical age has ardently believed that an unprecedented ‘crisis’ in youth behavior is taking place,”

human psyche needs three things to flourish: autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

when parents grow concerned with how much time their kids spend online, they often impose even more rules—a tactic that tends to backfire. Instead of more ways to limit your kids’ autonomy, Ryan advises seeking to understand the underlying needs and associated internal triggers driving them to digital distraction. “What we’ve found is that parents who address internet use or screen time with kids in an autonomy-supported way have kids who are more self-regulated with respect to it, so less likely to use screen time for excessive hours,”
