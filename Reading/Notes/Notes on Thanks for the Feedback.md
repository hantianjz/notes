# Notes on Thanks for the Feedback

- when we give feedback, we notice that the receiver isn't good at receiving it. when me receive feedback, me notice that the giver isn't good at giving it.
- feedback: feed corrective information back to the point of origin
- push harder feedback rarely actually work.
- â€œ The real leverage is create pull.

# Triggers
Our automatic triggers that prevent feedbacks.

- **Truth triggers**: off base; unhelpful; untrue
- **Relationship triggers**: feedback l colored by the relationship between the giver and receiver
- **Identity triggers**: our identity: and our sense of who we are.

# Truth Trigger (p27)

## 3 forms of feedback (p30)
- Appreciation
    - To see
    - Acknowledge
    - Connect
    - Motive
    - Thank
- Coaching
    - Help receiver expand knowledge
    - Address giver's feeling or imbalance in relationship
- Evaluation
    - Rate or rank
    - Align expectation
    - inform decision making

- Often receiver is looking for one type of feedback but got another one. Therefore it is always good to be upfront about the type of feedback giver is giving and the receiver is seeking.

> Know what you want, and know what you're getting.

- Avoid evaluation when your purpose is coaching.

### Appreciation
Three qualities of good appreciation:
- Be specific
- Come in the form the receiver values and hears clearly
- Be authentic

> Once crossed, these wires are tough to untangle.

### Coaching
- There's some amount of evaluation in all coaching.
- We constantly funnel the advice we get to either evaluation or coaching.

> Get purpose of feedback *aligned*, and *separating* (as much as possible) evaluation from coaching and appreciation.

### Evaluation
- We can't improve until we know where we stand

### Three Questions:
1. What's my purpose in giving/receiving this feedback?
2. Is it the right purpose from my point of view?
3. Is it the right purpose from other person's point of view?

> Explicit disagreement is better than implicit misunderstanding.

### The Feedback labels
Feedback tends to be given in generic labels, but they often can mean so much more, and be easily misunderstood.

#### Spot the label
> "Let me describe what I mean and you can ask me questions to see if I'm making sense"

A feedback can be broken down into:
- A past, where it came from, a *looking-back* component
- A future, what you need to do, a *looking-forward* component

Clarify these 2 components to make sense of the feedback label.

- Data => Interpretation => **Label** => Advice Consequences
- Feedback givers arrive at their labels in two steps:
    1. They observe data
    2. They interpret data
- We interpret what we see based on our own life experiences.
- We all look at data and jump to the label (the advise, the conclusion)

- An advice is clear when, if you *do* want to follow the advise, you know what to do. Else the advice need to be clarified with more actionable suggestions.

### When receiving evaluation
- Clarify consequences and expectations
    - What does this mean for me?
    - What will happen next?
    - What is expected of me?
    - Given where I stand, what should I do now?

## Wrong spotting vs difference spotting (p46)
- We instinctively spot wrong points when receiving hard feedback, to discredit the giver and the feedback. This is not helpful.
- Find the difference in data and point view between giver and receiver.
    - Difference in data
    - Difference in how the data is interpreted

> Tell me more: Let's figure out why we see this differently.

- We interpret the whole according to our set of implicit rules, the rules for how things should be, as **THE** rule for everything and everyone having the same rules. But everyone have a different set of rules.

> No experience you've had that you were not in the absolute center of

## Blind spots (p77)
The gap map
- My thoughts & feelings => My Intentions => My behaviour => My impacts on them => Their story about me
- Our own face is a blind spot, emotions leak out
- We formulate a "theory of mind" about those we interact with.
- We hear human voice with **superior temporal sulcus (STS)**, especially people speaking with emotions
- STS is off for our own speech.

### Blind-spot amplifiers
#### Emotional Math
- We subtract certain emotions from equations of how we are presented
- While others doubly use those emotions to judge us

#### Situation versus character
- Pretty much fundamental attribution error
- "I attribute my actions to the situation; you attribute my actions to my character"

#### Impact versus intent
- We judge ourselves by our intentions, while others judge us by our impacts.

### Discovery the blind spots
> You can't see yourself more clearly just by looking harder

- Get data from someone you trust
    - "What do you see me doing, or failing to do, that is getting my own way?"

# Relationship trigger

Receiver does not recognize giver's *credibility*, *trustworthiness*, *motives*

## Switchback dynamic (p102)
Two parallel related but different feedback and conversation happening at same time.

Feedback is happening in the context of the relationship but also because of it.

4 steps to the switchback dynamic
- We get feedback
- We experience a relationship trigger
- We change the topic to how we feel
- We talk past each other

2 Key kinds of relationship trigger:
1. What we think about the giver
2. How we feel treated by the giver

- Once we reject a feedback giver, based on trust, credibility, and skill or judgement, we will always reject the what of the feedback.

#### Skill or Judgement
- We often reject feedback based on where, when and how it was given
- Which ensure receiver to be hurt and discuss how they are hurt and start switchback dynamic.

#### Credibility
- We often reject feedback giver if we think they don't know what they are talking about

#### Trust
- We reject feedback giver if we don't trust their intentions

Handling feedback from people you don't like might bring you the most room to grow. This is when we are under stress or in conflict we lose skills we normally have.

### How we feel treated *by* them (p111)
- Appreciation
    - Do they see our efforts and successes?
- Autonomy
    - Are we given appropriate spaces and control
    - Need explicit conversation about the appropriate boundaries of autonomy
- Acceptance
    - Do they respect or accept who we are now.

To avoid switchbacking:
1. Spot the two topics on the table
2. Give each topic it's own conversation
3. Help giver be clear with original feedback

## Identify the relationship system (p123)
- A relationship is a system, a team is a system.
- It takes the two of you being the way you are to create the problem.

"This is how you are" ==> "This is how you are in relationship to how I am"
- Since people's behavior are relative to everyone else
- Notice what you are each doing in reaction to the other, spot the patterns.

- A role is like an ice cube tray into which you pour your personality. What you pour in matters, but so does the shape of the tray.
- If two people bump into each other often enough and cause enough frustration, each will consider the other an "**adversary**"

# Identity Trigger (p145)
Our biological wiring affect how we handle feedback
- our base mood
- The swing
- the recovery

50-40-10 formula of happiness
- 50% wired in biologically
- 40% how we interpret
- 10% the environment
We can only change the 40% of how we interpret

1. Be prepared, be mindful: Recognize your feedback footprint
2. Separate the strands: feeling / story / feedback
3. Contain the story: what this is about and what isn't about
4. Change your vantage point: to another, to the future, to the comedy
5. Accept that you can"t control how others see you

Identity is the story we tell ourselves about ourselves.

# Feedback in Conversation
## Boundaries (p209)

We don't have to accept all feedbacks.

Boundaries that can be set:
1. I may not take your advise.
    - Make it clear that advise will be listened, but may not be taken.
2. I don't want feedback about that subject, not right now.
    - Certain subject are just off limit and not even heard
3. Stop, or I will leave the relationship

### Consider drawing boundaries when:
- Unhelpful feedback is useless; relentless unhelpful feedback is destructive.
- Attacking the character instead behavior.
- Always one more demand
- Take emotional/relationship hostage
- Giver giving threats
- Only one side every has to change
- Do giver respect receiver autonomy? And change feedback based on receiver's view or feeling.

### Warning vs Threats
A warning is the consequences of not taking a feedback is legitimate and reasonable.
Where as a threat is when the consequence is manufactured to induce fear.

### When setting boundary, be clear about:
- The request, the exact boundary
- The time frame of the boundary
- Giver's assent
- The consequence

There is always another way out. Come up with some compromise, open up the problem for different solutions. Address the core concerns.

## Navigate the conversation (p229)

### Arc of the conversation:
- Open
- Body
- Close
