# Keep Going - 10 ways to stay creative in good times and bad

# 1. Every day is a groundhog day.
## Take one day at a time
- The question we have to answer for our life: *"What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?"*
- Creative life is NOT linear, but more like a loop.
> [!Groundhog Day]
> Yesterday's over, tomorrow may never come, there's just today and what you can do with it.

> [!Twenty-Four Hours a Day]
It is only when you and I add the burden of those two awful eternities, yesterday and tomorrow, that we break down. It is not the experience of today that drives men mad. It is remorse or bitterness for something which happened yesterday or the dread of what tomorrow may bring. Let us therefore do our best to live but one day at a time.

## Establish a daily routine
- Having a good daily routine maybe seem like doing time in prison. But aren't we all, in a sense, "doing time?" in this world?
- A routine protect you from the ups and downs of life
- Occasional break from routine will feel like a good prison break

## Finish each day and be done with it.
- No matter how bad a day get, see it through to the end so you can get to tomorrow.
- Every day is like a blank page: When you're finished filling it, you can save it, you can crumple it up, or you can slide it into the recycling bin and let it be. Only time will tell you what it was worth.

# 2. Build a bliss station.
## You can be woke without waking to the news

## Airplane mode can be a way of life.
- Things taken by phone: Loneliness, uncertainty, and boredom.
- First rule of writing is to "apply as to chair."

## Learn how to say NO
**JOMO: The Joy Of Missing Out.**

# 3. Forget the noun, do the verb.
## "Creative" is not a noun.
- Lots of people want to be the noun without doing the verb.
- Creative is never an end; it is means to something else.
- Job titles aren't really for you, they're for others.
- Forget the nouns altogether. Do the verbs.
- I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process.

## Your real work is play
> [!Vonnegut]
> Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake.

- When nothing's fun anymore, try to make the *worst* thing you can. Making intentionally bad art is a ton of fun.

# 4. Make gifts.
## Protect your valuables.
- One of the easiest ways to hate something you love is to turn it into your job: taking the thing that keeps you alive spiritually and turning it into the thing that keeps you alive *literally*.

## Ignore the numbers.
- All the clicks have meant in the short term is that everything online is now clickbait, optimized for the short attention span. The quick hit.
- When you ignore quantitative measurements for a bit, you can get back to qualitative measurements.
> [!Robert Farrar Capon]
> No artist can work simply for results; he must also like the work of getting them.

# 5. The ordinary + extra attention = the extraordinary
## You have everything you NEED
- Sister Mary Corita Kent, made common things "uncommon."
- The first step toward transforming your life into art is to start paying more attention to it.

## Slow down and draw things out.
- Drawing is really an exercise in seeing, makes you feel better.
> [!The mind's eye]
> Photography is an immediate reaction, drawing is a meditation.

> [!Frederick Franck]
> Drawing is the discipline by which I constantly rediscover the world. I have learned that what I have not drawn, I have never really seen, and that when I start drawing an ordinary thing, I realized how extraordinary it is, sheer miracle.

## Pay attention to what you pay attention to.
- Careful where you point at attention!
- Reread your diary, to uncover patterns

> [!Jessa Crispin]
> We give things meaning by paying attention to them, and so moving your attention from one thing to another can absolutely change your future.

> [!Jose Ortega y Gassett]
> Tell me what you pay attention and I will tell you who you are.

# 6. Slay the art monsters.
## Art is FOR life
- Art is supposed to make our lives better
- Find something else to do with your time, something that makes you and the people around you feel more alive.

# 7. You are allowed to change your mind.
## To change is to be alive.
- Natural state is one of not-knowing.
- You start each work not knowing exactly where you're going or where you'll end up.

## Like-minded vs Like-hearted
Be around more *like-hearted* people. These are people who are "temperamentally disposed to openness and have habits of listening." People who are generous, kind, caring, and thoughtful.

##  Visit the past
> [!Seneca]
> Why not turn from this brief and transient spell of time and give ourselves wholeheartedly to the past, which is limitless and eternal and can be shared with better men than we?

# 8. When in doubt, tidy up.
## Keep your tools tidy and your materials messy
- A mistake to equate productivity and creativity.
- Learn from chef and be more ready.
 
## Tidy is exploring
- Tidying up can be a form of productive procrastination, avoiding work by doing other work.
- Tidying in the hope of obtaining perfect order is stressful work.

## LEAVE THINGS BETTER THAN YOU FOUND THEM

# 9. Demons  hate fresh air.
## To EXERCISE is to EXORCISE

# 10. Plant your garden.
## This, too, shall PASS

> [!quote]
> This, too, shall pass, and they shall pass, too.

- [ ] Draw up some lists
- [ ] Hire a child to teach you to play
- [ ] Make a gift for someone

- [ ] Lie down for a nap
