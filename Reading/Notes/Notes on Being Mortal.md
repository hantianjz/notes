# Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End

# ðŸ“’ Summary + Notes

### 1. The independent self

We all like to maintain independence of our life, keep doing the things we like to do that make us happy.

But as we get older that become physically impossible. Historically we had family/children to take care of the old.

But as we live longer, social economic opportunities become more available for the young. The idea of taking care of the old is more of a trapping instead of what it was.

We used to die earlier and old people were a rarities, the one that survived was respected and relied upon for wisdom.

### 2. Things fall apart
