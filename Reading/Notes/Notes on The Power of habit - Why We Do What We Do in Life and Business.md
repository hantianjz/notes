# ðŸ“’ Summary + Notes

Why we do what we do and how to change.

1.  Identify the routine: (The action / process to change), what is the cue? the reward?
2.  Experiment with reward to identify the craving that is driving the routine.
3.  Identify the cue, by focus on different category.
4.  Have a plan.

## The habit loop

-â€”> Cue â€”> routine â€”> reward â€”> Cue

The cue is precise but also fragile. Small change will fail to trigger.

Basal ganglia "produce/process" routine for mental short cut.

## The craving brain

Not all routine can be easily changed/created.

Craving is created by cue, for the reward, and the routine satisfy the craving.

Developing proper craving make creating new habit easy. Craving drives habit.

## The golden rule of habit change

Habit can be hard to keep in face of stress or life.

There need the belief in the habit, that is can improve and it will work. Easier to change old habit than.

Hence why religion/group therapy help to create new habit.

Identify reward, and link cue and routine to it.

**"Once you know a habit exist, you have the responsibility to change"**

People going through major life event also change spending habit

People like familiar, and so to make people like new things, the new need to be packaged with the old

## How movements happen
