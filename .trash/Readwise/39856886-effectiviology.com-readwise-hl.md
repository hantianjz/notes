- Full Title: The Shirky Principle: Institutions Try to Preserve the Problem to Which They Are the Solution
- Summary: The Shirky Principle, formulated in a blog post by Kevin Kelly and based on the writing of scholar Clay Shirky, states that institutions tend to preserve the problem to which they are the solution. This can lead to intentional or unintentional perpetuation of problems. Examples of this behavior include tax-filing companies lobbying against free tax-filing options and private prison companies supporting policies that increase incarceration rates. The principle can apply to various entities, including individuals and small social groups, and can involve various patterns of behavior. Accounting for the Shirky Principle can help understand and predict behavior, and modify behavior when necessary.
