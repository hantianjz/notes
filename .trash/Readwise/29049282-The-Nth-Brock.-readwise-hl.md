# An America-Less Internet

## Metadata
- Author: [[The Nth Brock.]]
- Full Title: An America-Less Internet
- Summary: Nine out of the ten most visited websites in the United Kingdom are those operated by US organisations. The same cannot be said for the flip side. There are zero UK-operated websites found in the US’s top 50. Our accents are being adopted, but our websites are certainly not. They are as spiceless as our beige cuisine (But god I do love fish and chips).
This isn’t a gripe about where the UK sources its web from.

## Highlights
- Whether access to the internet a right or not, *what* I have access to is not guaranteed. I’m not expecting there to suddenly be a US-shaped hole in the routing table, but what if? Exactly how screwed would I be? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h30ctz1e4kazasp41prpgsrh))
