- Summary: In the wake of recent violent events, many people may feel helpless and numb, unable to take action or offer support. This feeling is known as empathic distress, where people feel overwhelmed and immobilized by the suffering of others. Empathy is not always helpful, and can even lead to depression or withdrawal. Instead, cultivating compassion can motivate people to reach out and offer comfort and support to those in need. Acknowledging people's pain, even if we cannot alleviate it, can make a difference and help combat feelings of helplessness.
