- URL: https://www.xorvoid.com/broken_builds.html

## Highlights
- When I get inside a build script file, there's only one thing I really want to do: Leave It ASAP and get back to the real task at hand. You can optimize for that if you like.. or not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1amj0ppa8q4rte7gj8rmt10))
    - Note: Build system is only means to an end, are rarely worth the time invested.
