# ‘Enshittification’ is coming for absolutely everything

## Metadata
- Author: [[Cory Doctorow]]
- Full Title: ‘Enshittification’ is coming for absolutely everything
- Summary: The term "enshittification" refers to the decay of online platforms like Facebook. The author explains that this happens in three stages: platforms are good to their users, then abuse their users to benefit business customers, and finally abuse the business customers to gain value for themselves. Companies like Facebook and Google have become too big to fail and too big to jail, and competition is needed to keep them in check. While regulation can help, tech workers themselves are the final bulwark against enshittification.
