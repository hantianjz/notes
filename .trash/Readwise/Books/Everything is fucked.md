## Highlights
- "I have tried to live my life such that in the hour of my death I would feel joy rather than fear." (Page 10)
- Our psyche needs hope to survive the way a fish needs water.
  Hope is the fuel for our mental engine. It's the butter on our biscuit. It's a lot of really cheesy metaphors. Without hope, your whole mental apparatus will stall out or starve.
- the construction of hope-then becomes our mind's primary project.
- To build and maintain hope, we need three things: a sense of control, a belief in the value of something, and a community.
- a sustaineable, benevolent form of hope. A hope that can bring us togethe rather than tear us apart. A hope that is robust and powerful yet still grounded in reason and reality. A hope that can carry ust the end of our days with a sense of gratitude and satisfaction
- When people prattle on about needing to find their "life's purpose," what they really mean is that it's no longer clear to them what matters, what is a worthy use of their limited time here on earth-in short, what to hope for. They are struggling to see what the before/after of their lives should be

- We must feel as though we're following through on what we know is good and right; that we're chasing after "something better." Yet many of us struggle with the inability to control ourselves.
- we are moved to action only by emotion. That's because action is emotion.
- NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF EMOTION: For Every Action, There Is an Equal and Opposite Emotional Reaction.
- Pain causes moral gaps.
- When confronted with moral gaps, we develop overwhelming emotions toward equalization, or a return to moral equality.
- Moral gaps are where our values are born.
- Feeling Brain creates our values around our experiences of pain.
- When we have experiences, our Feeling Brain creates a sort of value hierarchy.
- How we come to value everything in life relative to ourselves is the sum of our emotions over time.
- A person who believes he deserves special treatment because of how great he is isn't so different from someone who believes she deserves special treatment because of how shitty she is. Both are narcissistic. Both think they're special. Both think the world should make exceptions and cater to their values and feelings over others'.
- When our Feeling Brain feels something, our Thinking Brain sets to work constructing a narrative to explain that something.
- The stronger we hold a value, that is, the stronger we determine something as superior or inferior than all else, the stronger its gravity, the tighter its orbit, and the more difficult it is for outside forces to disrupt its path and purpose.
- Rituals connect us with the past. They connect us to our values. And they affirm who we are.
- the only thing that can ever truly destroy a dream is to have it come true.
- The people with natural advantages will accumulate more resources than others. And because they have more resources, they will have a disproportionate amount of power within this new society.
- Each religion is a faith-based attempt to explain reality in such a way that it gives people a steady stream of hope. In a kind of Darwinian competition, those religions that mobilize, coordinate, and inspire their believers the most are those that win out and spread throughout the world.
- To act without hope. To not hope for better. To be better.
- Everything is fucked. And hope is both the cause and the effect of that fuckedness.
- hope for nothing. Hope for what already is-because hope is ultimately empty.
- When you attempt to barter for happiness, you destroy happiness. When you try to enforce freedom, you negate freedom When you try to create equality, you undermine equality,
- The Formula of Humanity states, “Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means

- The quality of our lives is determined by the quality of our character, and the quality of our character is determined by our relationship to our pain.
- The only true form of freedom, the only ethical form of freedom, is through self limitation. It is not the privilege of choosing every thing you want in your life, but rather, choosing what you will give up in your life
