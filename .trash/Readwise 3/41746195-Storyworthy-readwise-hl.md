- Telling stories about your life lets people know they’re not alone; ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=178))
- No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story. — Daniel Kahneman ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=456))
- Your story must reflect change over time. A story cannot simply be a series of remarkable events. You must start out as one version of yourself and end as something new. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=580))
- If I had to tell a story from today — a five-minute story onstage about something that took place over the course of this day — what would it be? As benign and boring and inconsequential as it might seem, what was the most storyworthy moment from my day? ([Location 814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=814))
- All great stories — regardless of length or depth or tone — tell the story of a five-second moment in a person’s life. Got that? Let me say it again: Every great story ever told is essentially about a five-second moment in the life of a human being, and the purpose of the story is to bring that moment to the greatest clarity possible.

- Stakes are the reason an audience wants to hear your next sentence. ([Location 2451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=2451))
- Make sure that every moment in your story has a location attached. Every moment should be a scene, and every scene needs a setting. ([Location 3266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=3266))
- “causation between each scene that makes a story.” ([Location 3405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=3405))
- This is the trick to telling a big story: it cannot be about anything big. Instead we must find the small, relatable, comprehensible moments in our larger stories. We must find the piece of the story that people can connect to, relate to, and understand. ([Location 3599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=3599))
- 1.    Avoid thesis statements in storytelling.         2.    Heighten the contrast between the surprise and the moment just before the surprise.         3.    Use stakes to increase surprise.         4.    Avoid giving away the surprise in your story by hiding important information that will pay off later (planting bombs). ([Location 3926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=3926))
- Contrast is king in storytelling, and laughter can provide a fantastic contrast to something authentically awful. ([Location 4031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=4031))
- This is the magic of the present tense. It creates a sense of immediacy. ([Location 4401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=4401))
