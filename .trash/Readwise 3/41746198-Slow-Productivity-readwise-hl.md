# Slow Productivity

None

- 1. Do fewer things. 2. Work at a natural pace. 3. Obsess over quality. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C7716FW1&location=155))
- Strive to reduce your obligations to the point where you can easily imagine accomplishing them with time to spare. Leverage this reduced load to more fully embrace and advance the small number of projects that matter most. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C7716FW1&location=628))
