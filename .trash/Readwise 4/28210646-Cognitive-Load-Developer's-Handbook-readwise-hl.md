- Cognitive load is how much a developer needs to know in order to complete a task. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1aw29w0tasjqfc686myt2mv))
- Prefer composition over inheritance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1aw98s02x4tq130s0tmkank))
- **The best components are those that provide powerful functionality yet have simple interface.**

- A well-crafted monolith with truly isolated modules is often much more convenient and flexible than a bunch of microservices. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1c4p74vpqt8c2nm0k0589qm))
- when you come back later, you would have to recreate that thought process! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1c5v08dmy8zwxw8y7e3x3za))
- You not only have to understand this complicated program, you have to understand why a programmer decided this was the way to approach a problem from the features that are available. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1c5vmt9zrnqbzg5w6rdjph6))
- We can write code in a somewhat framework-agnostic way. The business logic should not reside within a framework; rather, it should use the framework's components. Put a framework outside of your core logic. Use the framework in a library-like fashion. This would allow new contributors to add value from day one, without the need of going through debris of framework-related complexity first.
