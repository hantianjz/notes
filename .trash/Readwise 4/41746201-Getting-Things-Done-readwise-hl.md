# Getting Things Done

- As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble. —Ralph Waldo Emerson ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=320))
- Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=333))
- three key objectives: (1) capturing all the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for you—now, later, someday, big, little, or in between—in a logical and trusted system outside your head and off your mind; (2) directing yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the “inputs” you let into your life so that you will always have a workable inventory of “next actions” that you can implement or renegotiate in the moment; and (3) curating and coordinating all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of commitments with yourself and others you will have at play, at any point in time.

- Life is denied by lack of attention, whether it be to cleaning windows or trying to write a masterpiece. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=550))
- Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an “open loop,” which will be pulling on your attention if it’s not appropriately managed. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=597))
- Managing commitments well requires the implementation of some basic activities and behaviors: First of all, if it’s on your mind, your mind isn’t clear. Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind, or what I call a collection tool, that you know you’ll come back to regularly and sort through. Second, you must clarify exactly what your commitment is and decide what you have to do, if anything, to make progress toward fulfilling it. Third, once you’ve decided on all the actions you need to take, you must keep reminders of them organized in a system you review regularly.

- What did change is the most important element for clarity, focus, and peace of mind: how you are engaged with your world. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=632))
- This consistent, unproductive preoccupation with all the things we have to do is the single largest consumer of time and energy. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=654))
- We need to transform all the “stuff” we’ve attracted and accumulated into a clear inventory of meaningful actions, projects, and usable information. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=685))
- the key to managing all of your stuff is managing your actions. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=715))
- the real problem is a lack of clarity and definition about what a project really is, and what associated next-action steps are required. ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=730))
- Getting things done requires two basic components: defining (1) what “done” means (outcome) and (2) what “doing” looks like (action). ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=732))
- capture what has our attention; (2) clarify what each item means and what to do about it; (3) organize the results, which presents the options we (4) reflect on, which we then choose to (5) engage with. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=833))
- A task left undone remains undone in two places—at the actual location of the task, and inside your head. Incomplete tasks in your head consume the energy of your attention as they gnaw at your conscience. ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=892))
- Do It, Delegate It, or Defer It Once you’ve decided on the next action, you have three options: 1. Do it. If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it is defined. 2. Delegate it. If the action will take longer than two minutes, ask yourself, Am I the right person to do this? If the answer is no, delegate it to the appropriate entity. 3. Defer it, If the action will take longer than two minutes, and you are the right person to do it, you will have to defer acting on it until later and track it on one or more “Next Actions” lists.
