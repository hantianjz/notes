# Dopamine Nation

- Addictions researcher Warren K. Bickel and his colleagues asked people addicted to opioids and healthy controls to complete a story that started with the line: "After awakening, Bill began to think about his future. In general, he expected to..."
  Opioid-addicted study participants referred to a future that was on average nine days long. Healthy controls referred to a future that was on average 4-7 years long. This striking difference illustrates how "temporal horizons" shrink when we're under the sway of an addictive drug. (Page 104)
- if we consume just the right amount, "inhibiting great pain with little pain," we discover the path to hormetic healing, and maybe even the occasional "fit of joy." (Page 170)
- When our lived experience diverges from our projected image, we are prone to feel detached and unreal, as fake as the false images we've created. Psychiatrists call this feeling derealization and depersonalization. It's a terrifying feeling, which commonly contributes to thoughts of suicide. After all, if we don't feel real, ending our lives feels inconsequential. (Page 192)
- Addiction broadly defined is the continued and compulsive consumption of a substance or behavior (gambling, gaming, sex) despite its harm to self and/or others.
