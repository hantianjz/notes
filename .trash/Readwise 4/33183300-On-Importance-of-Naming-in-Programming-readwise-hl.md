## Summary
In stories, you will often find the motif of a powerful demon that can be controlled only by knowing its true name. Once the hero finds out that name, through cunning dialogue or by investigating ancient tomes, they can turn things around and banish the demon!

- **Good name doesn’t misdirect, doesn’t omit, and doesn’t assume**.
  A good name should give you a good idea about what the variable contains or function does. A good name will tell you all there is to know or will tell you enough to know where to look next. It will not let you guess, or wonder. It will not misguide you. A good name is obvious, and expected. It is consistent. Not overly creative. It will not assume context or knowledge that the reader is not likely to have. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcqhgcwqh3fza5132b3cqwq2))
