# The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck

- The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=302))
- Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=326))
- Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=329))
- Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=370))
- Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=425))
- Emotions are simply biological signals designed to nudge you in the direction of beneficial change. ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=607))
- The person you marry is the person you fight with. The house you buy is the house you repair. The dream job you take is the job you stress over. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=630))
- true and accurate measurement of one’s self-worth is how people feel about the negative aspects of themselves. ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=739))
- Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times. ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1062))
- first layer of the self-awareness onion is a simple understanding of one’s emotions. ([Location 1064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1064))
- The second layer of the self-awareness onion is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions. ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1079))
- The third level is our personal values: Why do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me? ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1086))
- If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1183))
- This is why these values—pleasure, material success, always being right, staying positive—are poor ideals for a person’s life. Some of the greatest moments of one’s life are not pleasant, not successful, not known, and not positive. ([Location 1269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1269))
- We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1377))
- “With great responsibility comes great power.” ([Location 1403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1403))
- A lot of people hesitate to take responsibility for their problems because they believe that to be responsible for your problems is to also be at fault for your problems. ([Location 1419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1419))
- Certainty is the enemy of growth. Nothing is for certain until it has already happened—and even then, it’s still debatable. ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1683))
