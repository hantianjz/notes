# Coders at Work

## Metadata
- Author: [[Peter Seibel]]
- Full Title: Coders at Work

## Highlights
- I always find that a good way to sort of immerse yourself in a piece of code is pick a task you want to accomplish and then try and do it. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ACC2536&location=753))
- You've got to say in the comment something that's not there already. What's it for? Either a higher-level or a lower-level description, depending on what's most important. Sometimes the most important thing is, what is this for? Why would I use it? And sometimes the most important thing is, what's the range of inputs that this expects?

- One of the things that makes a piece of writing tasteful is if it's structured in a way that's easy to grasp. Are the facts loaded up at the front or are they scattered around? If you're referring back—if you're flipping through a book, can you figure out where in the book is the thing you kind of remember?

- Thinking like a scientist; changing one thing at a time. Patience and trying to understand the root cause of things. Especially when you're debugging something or designing something that's not quite working. I've seen young programmers say, “Oh, shit, it doesn't work,” and then rewrite it all. Stop. Try to figure out what's going on. Learn how to write things incrementally so that at each stage you could verify it.

- “If you can't write in your native language, give it up.” ([Location 2434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ACC2536&location=2434))
- Yeah, read a lot. There are good books out there. Find the good ones and read those. ([Location 2529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ACC2536&location=2529))
- As they say, it's easier to optimize correct code than to correct optimized code. ([Location 3317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ACC2536&location=3317))
