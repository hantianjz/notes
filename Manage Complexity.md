# Manage Complexity

[[What is Gall's Law]] is another way to say that complexity management take time and needs to be evolved into instead of build from scratch.

[[Think in Simplicity|Simplicity]] is the other side of the coin.

If there is too much concentration of complexity, it become hard to decode.
And inefficient!!
