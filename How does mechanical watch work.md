# How does mechanical watch work

Time keeping system consists of just seven major elements.

## Power
Power is derived from a **spiral torsion spring**.

It is housed in a **barrel** to contain the **main spring**
![[Pasted image 20221003105652.png|300]]

A **arbor** is attached in the center of the spring to wind it up

With the **arbor** held in place, it will rotate the barrel

This is the main spring in completely relaxed position.

There is a **metal strip** in the main spring that add additional tension to its outer part. That metal strip really want to snap back to its straight shape. Which create a lot of friction on the wall of the barrel keeping the spring in place.

The main spring when relaxed forms a S-shape. This helps balance tension in main spring's different sections when it is inside of the barrel. Since the inside of the spring would be bent more and under more tension, and out part less bent and less tension.

Unfortunately, the **mainspring** by itself can not drive the second hand, as it will rotate it too fast and unwind for more than a second.

We want our watch to run continuously for around 40 hours on a single wind. We need minute hand to complete 40 rotations, and 40 x 60 = 2400 rotations for second hands.
Need a way to translate small revolution of barrel into large number of rotations.

## Gears
Each tooth in one gear meets within a space between teeth in other gear.

Mechanical watches use a *train* of gears with multiple gears working in pairs.

Each big gear drives a smaller gear called a *pinion*, mounted on the same shaft as next big gear, so keep increasing the speed of each axis. Use smaller overall mechanism, and use one of intermediate wheels to rotates slower minute and hour hands.

Shape of the teeth use an involute shape for the profile of the gear teeth. Mechanical watches commonly use [*cycloidal*](https://www.tec-science.com/mechanical-power-transmission/cycloidal-gear/geometry-of-cycloidal-gears/) profile.

## Escapement
![[Pasted image 20221006214348.png|300]]

The two component that create the escapement is an *escape wheel* and *pallet fork*.
The *pink* end at *pallet fork* is made of synthetic ruby to prevent wear, and low coefficient of friction with steel.

The *barrel* is wound up, trying to rotate the *escape wheel*, but locked by *pallet fork*. Only briefly during the toggle of *pallet fork* does the barrel rotate. The toggle == tick-tock.

## Balance
The *balance* allows the *pallet fork* to tick automatically at the appropriate cadence.

The size of the rotate arm, slows down the rotation, and width of torsion spring speed up the rotation. A tuned combination allows the system to oscillate at the desired rate, which is the source of precise time tracking.

The balance wheel toggles the *pallet fork* via a jewel roller.
