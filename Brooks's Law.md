# Brooks's Law

Brooks's law is an observation about [software project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_project_management "Software project management") according to which "adding [manpower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources "Human resources") to a late software project makes it later".

It was coined by [Fred Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks "Fred Brooks") in his 1975 book _[The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month "The Mythical Man-Month")_. According to Brooks, under certain conditions, an incremental person when added to a project makes it take more, not less time.
