# Notes on Everything is F%cked

# Part 1: Hope

## The Uncomfortable Truth
Our life does not have any inherent meaning or purpose. In the context of infinite universe we as a person does not matter.

> [!Coffee Cup note]
>  One day, you and everyone you love will die. And beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, a little of what you say or do will ever matter. This is the Uncomfortable Truth of life. And everything you think or do is but an elaborate avoidance of it. We are inconsequential cosmic dust, bumping and milling about on a tiny blue speck. We imagine our own importance. We invent our purpose-we are nothing.

It is part of our biology that we need meaning to [[Everything is fucked#^188ad8|survive]], our mind have to [[Everything is fucked#^055cee|construct]] meaning and hope.

Our psyche needs something valuable, or meaning, and we have the control, or autonomy to chase it, and an group of community also seeking that meaning. This theme is [[Everything is fucked#^763078|repeated]] [[Indistractable#^304526|in]] a few places.

This is why religions exist and flourishes, they provide the story of meaning, and hope and teaches one how to obtain the meaning, and the group of people in the religion help reinforce the idea.

The hope we construct for ourself does not need to be from religion, it can be anything. The hard part is building a hope that is sustainable, benevolent, robust, powerful, that is grounded in reason and reality and can brings us together and provide us with a sense of gratitude and satisfaction.

## Self-Control is an Illusion
Elliot was someone who was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He was luckily to be able to have it removed and survived.
Elliot's life fell apart after the surgery, he was unable to determine what is good or bad for him. He no longer felt good or bad about anything.

The classical assumption was people operate by reason and emotions, if we remove the emotions, reason will take over and people will be completely rational. Our reason/rational mind must dominate our emotions.
But if the classical assumption was true, we *should* be able to control our behaviour, our addiction. Therefore any failure to control ourself is due to an inherently damaged in ourself, or we are just not trying hard enough, or we are just lazy.
This is true, because lobotomized people's life did not change or get better, instead they all got way worse.

> We are moved to action only by emotion. That's because action *is* emotion.

This is similar to how dopamine drive our action. We seek the release or dopamine, and perform actions that we think will cause dopamine release.

## Newton's Laws of Emotion

### For Every Action, There Is an Equal and Opposite Emotional Reaction

Every action that happens to us create an emotional response in us. I.E. Someone punch us, we feel anger or hurt. We feel we are wongged and deserved something in return. This create an moral gap in us, and in turn we form a value judgement.

A negative moral gap is bad, and positive moral gap end up good.

We create values based off our experiences, and the moral gaps they create. From all these we create a value hierarchy.

### Our Self-Worth Equals the Sum of Our Emotions Over Time

When a moral gap persist long enough, it is normalized. It become our default expectation.

Our mind try to explain the moral gap by finding fault in ourselves. We give in and accept defeat. 

How we come to value everything in life relative to your selves is the sum of our emotions over time.

The reverse is also true. If given a bunch of stuff without earning it (Rich/Power parents, born race, etc...) We believe ourselves inherently superior to what we actually are.

Self-worth is contextual.

The more insecure you are about something, the more you'll fly back and forth between delusional feelings of superiority and delusional feelings of inferiority.

Self-worth is an illusion.

### Your Identity Will Stay Your Identity Until a New Experience Acts Against It

The longer you hold on to a value, the more it will become your identity, and stronger you will hold it. The more you will defend it when under attack.
And harder for it external force to change it.

## How to Make All Your Dreams Come True
aka *How to start your own religion*

1. Sell hope to the hopeless
We are most vulnerable when things are at their worst when it is hopeless.
That is easiest to convince people to a new purpose.
This is why all major religions have a history of sending missionaries to poorest and destitute corners of the world. Starving people will believe anything if it will keep them fed.

2. Choose your faith
- Spiritual religions: 
    - Supernatural beliefs
    - High Risk/High Reward, require most skill
    - I.E. Christianity, Islam
- Ideological religions:
    - Some kind ism. Normal occurrence. 
    - I.E. Capitalism, libertarianism
- Interpersonal religions: 
    - Easy to form, and quick to detach
    - I.E. Romantic love, celebrities, political leaders

Religion is all about emotional attachment.

3. Preemptively invalidate all criticism or outside questioning
Construct narrative that those not with us is against us. Therefore all criticism becomes the root of evil and the very thing that is fighting against.

4. Ritual sacrifice for dummies-So easy, anyone can do it!
Build common experience to bond the group.

5. Promise heaven, deliver hell
Never actually deliver what was promised, this to keep the believers hooked. In addition giving them exactly the opposite of the promised will strengthen the faith.

6. Prophet for profit
All religion's god value will eventually shift and become the preservation of the religion itself.

## Hope is Fucked
Spiritual religions kept people hopeful in a world without any growth or change ever.
All spiritual religions faces the problem of *evidence*. There is no way to proof the existence of god or spirits and angle. When something horrible happens in the world, people question why the all powerful god allowed it to happen. Through out history, the *authorities* of various religions spend a lot of effort try to hide the lack of evidence.
But in general given the way most religions are setup, it is possible to explain away the faults or lack of evidence, and generally does not bring down the whole religion.
Until the scientific revolution.
Science was a new religion, where it required evidence. The need for evidence for everything was the god value. Everything else revolved around this. The entire scientific system can change and that be alright for everyone. It evolved and improved upon itself. It is open to anybody and everybody.
It was very easy for the whole world to believe in science.

In addition it brought about real change, people can observe improvement to their lives in very short period. People no longer needed spiritual religion to improve things for them in the next life. They can grasp change in this life time themselves.
> The ability to look back and see progress, see growth happen, changed how people viewed the future. It changed how they viewed themselves.

People had **opportunity**, **freedom**, and **responsibility** for themselves to grow and improve their own life.

This opened the door for ideological religions, because people still needed framework for thinking about the world. Just like spiritual religion, they needed mental abstraction or ideals to guide them in the world to make decisions.
They needed to make value judgements themselves now.

Most ideological religions are built on top of *master* or *slave* morality, or mix of both.
- Democracy being everyone is equal.
- Nationalism some part of master morality values, setting up us against them.
- Communism everyone equal to the extreme
- Colonialism pure master morality, strongest take all.

All ideal being based off *master* and *slave* morality will always run into conflict with other ideas. *These conflicts must exit because they maintain the meaning and purpose for people within the group* 

But unlike spiritual religion, ideological religion is not **infallible**.
Each *ism* have their own problems, and is far good a framework.

And without a strong ideological religion, people lose hope much faster than before. With spiritual religion, it was at least good enough to keep most people hopeful.

Hope is fundamental to our psychology. We all need:
1. Something to look forward to
2. Believe ourselves in control of our fate enough to achieve that something
3. Find a community to achieve it with us

> Everything being fucked doesn't require hope; hope requires everything being fucked.

We only hope for a better job if we find something about our current job not good enough. We hope for a better house if we don't like our current house. We hope for a better body, because ...etc.

> Hope depends on the rejection of what currently is.

> [!Amor fati]
> Hope for nothing. Hope for what *already* is, because hope is ultimately empty.

> To act without hope. To not hope for better. To be better.

> Everything is fucked. And hope is both the cause and the effect of that fuckedness.

# Part 2: Everything is Fucked

## The formula of Humanity

### How we become adults
As children we discover and explore the worlds, we learn to avoid pain and seek pleasure. I.E. Avoid getting burned by the stove, and try to eat as much ice cream.
As we grow older into adolescent, we realize that always directly seeking our pleasure and avoiding pain does not always work. We need to take into account of the desire of the people around us in order to get the pleasure we want. I.E. Follow the social norms to fit in the group, be honest to get rewarded for it, share the food so other will share back. They follow certain general principle to get the pleasure they desire. This is all conditional, or transactional. If the principle does not yield what they desire, they don't follow it.
As adult, we learn to follow principles for the sake of it. I.E. Be honest for the sake of honesty because it is the right thing, despite sometime it maybe inconvenient or make us worse off in the short term. We stick to our principles because it is not just for us, but something larger than ourself.

Society as a whole is also similar, this is why most major spiritual religion try to push people towards those unconditional principles because it is better for the whole society.

### The One Rule for Life
The only scarce and unique thing is consciousness.
The only thing that differentiate us from reset of the matter in the universe, to reason and take the world around us and through reason and will improve the world around us.

The supreme value in the universe is *the thing that conceives of value itself*. The only true meaning in existence is *the ability to form meaning*.

We choose meaning, imagine importance, to invent purpose, and propagate.
Spread intelligence and generate greater and greater levels of organization.
Without intelligence/consciousness we would not be able to change, to improve, or create. They are just there.

> **The formula of Humanity states, "Act that you use humanity, wether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means**.

You must treat humanity never merely as a means, but always as an end itself.

## Pain is the universal Constant
Our perception of everything can be distorted if we are constantly exposed to it.
I.E. Judges constantly exposed to a lot of unethical, shady shit. They will normalize and start seeing unethical and shady shit when there is none. 

More examples:
- In the pre-Uber/Grab days, we were willing to wait for 30 min for a taxi to come. Today we complain if there is a delay of even 5 min.
- Wifi speed was a fraction of what we experience today. Yet, we quibble and complain that the Wifi is slow if a page load takes a few seconds more than usual.
- In the days of snail mail, we were willing to wait for a response for 30 days. Today with email, we complain if we don’t get a response in a few hours. Convenience has improved but satisfaction has not.
- A decade back, someone was living in a small apartment and very contented. Today, the same family lives in a Villa with a much higher living standard and feels less satisfied than before.

Our level of perception/bias on something will move as more we are exposed to it.

This is the Blue Dot Effect. The better things get, the more we perceive threads where there are none, and the more upset we become. It is at the heart of paradox of progress.

A well protected/safe environment won't make people happier, it will only make people stress over some minor things.

Our mind amplify (or minimize) our problem to our expected emotional reaction level.

Pain is the one true constant in our life.
Positive emotions are the temporary removal of pain; negative emotions the temporary augmentation of it.
There is no escape the experience of pain, but pain is the experience.

Nassim Taleb proposed there are 3 types of system:
- A fragile one like a vase that crushes easily to change.
- A oil drum that resist change and very strong
- One "antifragile" system that improves and become stronger from stressors and external pressures.

When we pursue pain, we choose what pain we bring into our lives. This make the pain meaningful, and what makes life feel meaningful.

## The Feelings Economy
The economy runs on people's feelings.

There are 2 ways to create value in the market place:
1. Innovations (upgrade pains): Better medicine trading sickness with longer life dealing with life.
2. Diversions (avoid pain): numb the pain. Delay the pain.

May company or market do horrible businesses, selling drugs, junk food. These company tend to use the justification that they are just giving people what they want.
> Give the people what they want is a pretty low bar to clear, ethically speaking.

Freedom itself demands discomfort. The freer a society becomes, the more each person will be forced to reckon and compromise with views and life styles and ideas that conflict with their own.

## The Final Religion

As technology and AI slowly take over the world more and more. It's complexity become impossible for any person to reason about. This is already the case with ML models, and LLM. We will start to treat these entities that control our life like *"gods"*, trying to guess how it works. Eventually we will start use all kind of *"ritual"* to please the *"gods"* to make it work in our favor.
This will become a whole new religion, just like the spiritual religions before.
