[[20240711Thu150606|Reactive system]] tends to be state machines

Reactive system are difficult to describe, it is a sequence of input/output events, conditions and actions. A set of sequences does not fit nicely into our frame of mind. Also hard to decompose or abstract into simpler components.

Finite state machines and typical state-transition diagrams can not describe complex systems. It become unmanageable, exponentially growing multitude of states.

A good state/event approach must be modular, hierarchical and well-structured. 

Qualities needed:
1. Ability **cluster** state into superstate
2. **Independence** or **orthogonality** of event/states
3. **General transitions** more than single event transition
4. Captures **refinement** of states, a high level overview of stats

**statecharts** = **state-diagrams** + **depth** + **orthogonality** + **broadcast-communication**`
