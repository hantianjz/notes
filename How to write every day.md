# How to write every day
1. Design your writing routine in a single sentence
    - I.E. "Every morning at 8am, I will sit down at my desk with a cup of coffee and write for 20 minutes"
2. Set a consistent output cadence.
    - Need to publish what I write consistently to get feedback
3. Use the 2 year Test to come up with ideas for your core topics
    - Over the last 2 years, what
        - Skills have you built?
        - Struggles have you faced?
        - Hobbies have you picked up?
        - Problems you have overcome?
        - Topics have you learned about?
    - **Writing is 95% overcoming the feeling that ideas you have to share are obvious - they aren't!**
    - With topics, generate ideas using 4A framework
        - Actionable (Here's how)
        - Analytical (Here's a breakdown)
        - Aspirational (yes, you can)
        - Anthropological (Here's why)
    - With the 4A framework use these methods
        - Tips 
        - Stats 
        - Steps 
        - Stories 
        - Quotes 
        - Benefits 
        - Lessons 
        - Reasons 
        - Mistakes 
        - Examples 
        - Questions 
        - Frameworks
4. Overcome procrastination by killing your "onces"
    - The timing will never be right.
5. Immerse yourself in accountability & community
