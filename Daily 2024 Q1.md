Feynman technique: explain complex concepts to a 5 yr old  
  
Blurting method:  
read information you want to learn, then rewrite as much of the information as you can, without looking at the information. You can do this with your textbook, lectures, or videos online. Once you’re done, look to see what gaps you have in your understanding, and what areas you have on lock. Repeat, while focusing on your knowledge gaps until you can write everything.  
  
Spaced repetition:  
Creating a spaced repetition, study schedule is helpful so you’re creating stronger connections with the knowledge you’re learning  
  
Parkinson’s law:  
Work under pressure and with deadlines. If not, work will always use more than the time it needs to be completed. This is based on how much time you give it.  
  
Pareto principal:  
80% of your grades is dependent on 20% of your study efforts. Are your current methods that efficient?  
  
Yerkes Dodson Principle:  
We want studying to be easy, but it’s been shown that challenging study effort produces greater results

Our home is 1751 sq feet + 546 sq feet basement

![[Pasted image 20240103222531.png]]

- We don't have fireplace
- Also only 2 full bathroom, 1 half bathroom
- The living area is only 1751 sq feet, 546 sq basement is unfinished

Please see separately attached page

We feel our property is overvalued due to incorrect data the city data base have on the property, and as a result is valuing our property closer to other bigger and more expensive properties.
The following items regarding our condo differs from what the city have in its database:
- Fire place, our condo do NOT have a fire place.
- Bathrooms, our condo only have 2 full bathrooms, and a half bathroom
- Living area, our condo's living area is only 1751 sq ft, where additional 546 sq ft is unfinished basement, which should be valued differently.
 
I am attaching our whole condo floor map to this application as supporting evidence.

I am also attaching a sample list of sales data from 2022 in same neighborhood with similar living area to our property for your consideration. We feel our property value should be valued around $1,100,000, which is the average value of these properties attached.

1. Take Time Outs: When things get too heated in conflict, we have agreed to take a step back and give each other space. We promise to return to the conversation once we have calmed down and can communicate more effectively. This agreement allows us to avoid saying hurtful things in the heat of the moment and promotes healthier conflict resolution.  

2. We have each other’s back publicly and privately: We have made a pact to never speak poorly of each other, especially to others, including our children. We believe that maintaining respect and admiration for one another is crucial for a strong and loving partnership. By speaking positively about each other, we create a supportive and uplifting environment for our family.  
  
3. Take Responsibility for Triggers: We both acknowledge that we have triggers that can affect our emotions and reactions. Instead of blaming each other, we commit to taking care of ourselves when we’re triggered in a way that benefits our relationship. This agreement helps us navigate through difficult moments with empathy and understanding.  

4. Embrace Imperfections: We accept that we are not perfect and that we both have faults. We have vowed to never shame or criticize each other for our imperfections. Instead, we choose to embrace and support each other’s growth. This agreement fosters a culture of acceptance and allows us to grow together as individuals and as a couple.  

5. We share our truth (even when it’s hard or scary) We have agreed to share our thoughts and feelings in a respectful and clear way, even if we think it may upset the other person. It’s incredibly important NOT to withhold your truth from your partner just because you think it will make them upset. Allowing your partner to have their authentic reaction and feelings is a huge part of relational health.
