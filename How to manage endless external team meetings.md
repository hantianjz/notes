# How to manage endless external team meetings

Make your roadmap public and obvious. Include priority on high level items. Refer people to this in meeting agenda.

Publish office hours and decline feature request meetings before socialization.

Request meetings without agendas be rescheduled until one is present. Decline meetings with no agenda more than 24h before the meeting. Make it obvious you do this.

Ask your PM to get more involved in engaging these teams.

Make a record of the asks and suggest to your director that you or your adjacent teams are understaffed.

Reduce modularity-related tech debt in your system, allowing people to self-serve. Prioritize this and decline new FRs. Promote new method when delivered.

Find commonalities in the requests and address them holistically so people stop asking for specific features.
