# Psychology on Procrastination
The root of procrastination for most people ain't laziness, it is anxiety.
Procrastination is the silent dream killer.
The best way to get something done is to begin.
Your anxiety will tell you the worst case scenario. It's a dame liar.
If you're a procrastinator, you will find every excuse not to do what you need to do.
DO IT FIRST, I call it reverse procrastination.

## Discover Your Response
Recognize your excuses. How do you succeed in dissuading yourself?
Know and recognize the strategies that can prevent you from making these excuses.

## Set A limit
Set a time limit for each task or goal you have to accomplish.

## Imagine your future self
Picture how wonderful it will be to have completed the task.
It keeps you away from the instant gratification of wanting to differ.

## Break your work into little steps
part of the reason why we procrastinate is that subconsciously, we find the work too overwhelming for us.
Break it down into little parts, then focus on one part at a time.

## Avoid Distractions
Keep away from things that have the power to distract you from the task or goal you have in mind.

## Definite Plan
Set a specific time to begin and chunky goal to achieve.
plan weekly, but tasks are done daily!

## Be compassionate
Take away any negative actions and utterances that are counterproductive.
Forget the failures and past tense. Focus on the task ahead.

## Hangout with people who inspire you to take action
Identify the people, who trigger you - most likely the go-getters and hard workers - and hang out with them more often.
Soon you will inculcate their drive and spirt too.

## Stop over-complicating Things
Are you waiting for a perfect time to do this?
Ditch that thought because there's never a perfect time.
If you keep waiting for one, you are never going to accomplish anything.

## Start
Motivation follows actions.

A Piece at a time throws you back into action and keeps plunging you until you are done

## Conclusion
Procrastination is a time killer, don't get comfortable with it.
Rather, choose to beat it each day and be the best of yourself.
