I think deep down inside I have the habit of running away from problems. We all do, it is probably most people's instinct. But I have also run away from enough problems to know that I have to face them eventually.
So what is the problem I am facing right now? Am I not listening?
What is some attribute about my wife:
- She can be very focused on what she is currently doing
- She is very analytical minded
- She is detailed oriented on things she care about.
- She tries really hard to make this work
I think part of reason this is

Lot of things going on today, as I am sitting down starting to write this. My instinct was to step away and back to my comfort zone. Back to just watching youtube and things to distract me on.
She was right that I have this instinct habit of turning to youtube whenever I am waiting on code compile and testing to run. This is drastically effecting my attention.
Getting back to force me to read long form for extended period of time. I had all of these habits in me, but none of the would stick in the long run.
Need to focus on a few things to improve first.
- No more PMO
    - This means also no social media
    - I am finding this slightly harder than it should be, my mind is bored on those down moments
    - The thing I was so proud of came back to hunt me
    - This all really started with when I got the iphone, but of course a lot of other things also happened in those time
- Daily morning pages (maybe?)
    - This somehow require me actually waking up early everyday in the morning
    - I don't feel I have a reason lately to wake up in the morning, if not for the deadline
    - there isn't anything in the morning that make me excited to wake up anymore.
    - This kind of make me sad.
- Something else I should really try to get better at, spending less money!!
    - OMG do I spend so much money on random toys
    - And all the subscription service I am into right now

The idea of hope is transactional 
We hope for future
We fight for a cause hoping the effort will bring a new and better future
This is good and important 
But there is means to and end. What are the guiding principles to what transaction to take
A pure transactional natural will eventually fail, not all transactions will work out
What happens when the transaction we hope for does not work out
What happens when the transaction stops working, because our human nature get used to it
And this is the problem, most religion or ideals will become corrupted with time, no matter how pure it started out.
The same action will stop make us happy and we need more to sustain the same level of happiness 
This is not long term sustainable, and will eventually fail us. We are trapped in the hedonistic cycle
The only way to break out is to break out the transactional nature of our life

What I have been reading: everything is fucked.
- the uncomfortable truth of life is that nothing matters and everything is meaningless. We creat our own meaning to help us live through this life.
    - the fact that life is meaningless is good and bad things 
    - on one hand we are free to creat our own meaning, on the other hand our meaning of life can get influenced and manipulated 
    - It be nice to aim for a meaning of life that contribute to the group we live in
- Newton law of emotions 
    - Every action have a equal emotional reaction 
    - Our self worth equal the sum of our emotions over time
    - Our identity will be the same until a new experience act against it
- Self control through pure discipline is an illusion 
    - We are emotional beings at end of day we are driving by emotions 
    - We need emotions because it generates values in us, what’s important and priorities 
- hope is fucked
    - Hope exist because everything is fucked
    - If everything was great we would not be hoping for better things 
    - To hope is to reject the current state of things.

Doing a lot of bag research and finally decided on the able carry max. Seemed like a reasonable and affordable choice. I get the feeling no matter which bag I go with it will have different problems. My only problem with evergood bag I had was the lack of laptop space. It really bothered me. I do hope the new bag can help with organizing. And am can help with organizing. And am very excited to be getting it.

> 
> Answer:  According to policy adjustments effective on 15 March 2023, if you hold a Chinese Visa issued before 28 March 2023 which is still valid, you may enter China without re-applying for a new one. If the visa has expired, kindly apply for a new one.

My reading pattern is still very sparse. Too scattered and having trouble focusing. The sudden urges to do something else. I do feel that for a really long time I am been forcing my self to become someone I want to become instead of facing the reality of the person that I am. I actually don’t like writing on paper all the time. The act of physical writing is not that enjoyable, it is only a novelty sometimes. I enjoy materialistic things more than I would like to admit. 
I am not facing the true reason why I can’t control myself, the self control part is hard. This addiction is a crutch. It is my avoidance tool. I am using it to numb my emotions. Too much of this is habit is helping me to avoid.
JB seems to like the live tracking, but I am a little scared of all the mess hap I made been found out the imperfections be called out. I need to slow down and just be a little bit more cautious.
Back to who I am and am not, I really like snowboarding, but also realizing that it was doing it with Cheng that made snowboarding so much enjoyable. Doing these for people you love the common activities is much more important. This is the same with my gap year trip. While short solo trip are nice and fun. I do actually enjoy traveling with people. The best trips in my live been with Richard and Cheng. I will always remember Hawaii and Banff. But my Europe trips are slowly fading in my memory. The EBC trip was great and all but I got lucky, it would have been miserable if I hadn’t met Dan and, oh god I am blanking out on the German’s name. Sigh…
So I need to be more honest with my self more going forward.
It is still unclear what my core values and the metrics are, but we need to start be truthful at least.
