# Think in Simplicity

# Effective people think simply
[[Kathleen Eisenhardt]]

A company with complex product development process make building the wrong thing very efficiently.
A company without any rule, nothing get done but people have a good time.
A middle ground, with a few simple rules. Who is in charge is what, and what product do we do.

## What is the underlay objective?
But the hard solution is what to do to actually change to achieve the objective.

## How to define your own rule?
Use your own data to find the patterns and how to repeat that.

## Simple why?
Make decisions faster?
Often possibly better decision.
Easier to remember.

Start simple, finding something simple that works, similar to [[What is Gall's Law]]

Starting small, allows the trade offs to work themselves out over time.
