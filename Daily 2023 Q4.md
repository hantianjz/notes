The main plot of termination shock can be summed up in 2-3 chapters really.
But I still enjoy reading Neal Stephenson for some of the random tangents.

The idea of I am lost really means I don't know what I want to spend my time on. that is worth my energy.
what am i doing right now?
Right now I feel like I am paralyzed by all the choices in my life. I don’t know what to spend my time on anymore?
I fear wasting the little time I have, I fear picking the wrong thing to focus on, it does feel easier to just distract my self with other things? The none important things?

The things I like to learn?
- Lua programming
- Zephyr framework
- Learn to write, write about a system, how to introduce into a system.
- writing topics?
- Learn to spell better
- keep up with learning Japanese 

- What I have done today
    - Walking the dog
    - getting coffee
    - wasted a lot of time on computer not doing anything productive
    - The early dinner was great, and made me really happy with the portion and the flow of it. I do wish the dinner was longer and more filling?
    - Wholefood checkout lady was funny.
        - I get to the wholefood checkout, slowly organize my shit on the belt, waiting for my turn. Somehow the checkout station at Wholefood have gotten extreme tech upgrade. There is a pay my palm, you can scan your prime account for discounts. I didn’t get a chance to try the palm paying thing, but I always scan my prime account. It used to be that the clerk would scan my phone with their bar code scanner, but now they have a machine for that. And I always had issue with that for some reason but I never bother figure out since I am rarely at a whole foods. So what was interesting today was the, the checkout lady is this older fisty lady that saw me struggling with the machine, and had to instruct me to how to properly place it, and I did not fully understand or follow it correctly. Almost felt like momements when I am teaching my parents how to do tech related things. Anyways, in the end it turns out the scanner was expecting the phone to be placed vertically, at this super low position that is actually super awkward for me to even hold the phone, while the sign had arrows pointed differently. This is a really  feels like a bad UX moment, where nothing was intuitive. But what made this a super interesting exchange was that another lady doing the bagging that made a comment about how the checkout lady actually really enjoy teaching young folks about technology.
- What does my life look like 5 years from now if I continue down on the same path?
continue doing embedded work, the same commercial/consumer hardware. Maybe finically better, but only slightly. Still a lot of small fights with CL. 

- What does my look like 5 years from now if I take a completely different path?
- What does my life look like if I take a different path but not worry about money or others’ opinions?

- What does my life look like 5 years from now if I continue down on the same path?
    - continue doing embedded work, the same commercial/consumer hardware. Maybe finically better, but only slightly. Still a lot of small fights with CL.
    - My body is going to slowly start feel worse and slower, more pains
    - I am still going to have unsatisfactory bed life.
    - I think mainly I am going to feel lost during my spare time.
    - What I am doing with my down time, when I am not working?
    - My work output is dropping due to late start, and unfocused work hours.
    - I am probably going to have a kid or 2. likely spending most of time taking care of them, my professional life is likely going to take a hit.
    - So the level I am operating right determines how much I am going to operate at when the kid comes.
    - I am not happy with my level of output, why? I am not writing, I am not doing enough new things? The knowledge I have gained is not put into a system. I am not building a set of systems.
    - I don't think there isn't a single thing that's missing from my life, I am just not executing enough.
    - I need to consistently improve, and reflect, and fix myself.

- What does my look like 5 years from now if I take a completely different path?
