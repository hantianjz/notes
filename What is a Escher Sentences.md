# What is a Escher Sentences
**AKA**: Comparative illusions (Cls)

Definition: A sentences which initially seem acceptable but upon further reflection have no well-formed meaning.

The effect has also been observed in other languages. Some studies have suggested that, at least in English, the effect is stronger for sentences whose predicate is repeatable. The effect has also been found to be stronger in some cases when there is a plural subject in the second clause.
