# Write Cold Email

Powerful/wealthy/interesting people read their own email.
But they always have very little time. Anything with "friction" get sorted to later bucket.

Cold email is:
1. Short and grab attention.
2. Super clear on who you are. Link to your body of work, a super impressive title.
3. Value prop for the receiver.
4. Has a specific ask. Low work that can be done in seconds.
