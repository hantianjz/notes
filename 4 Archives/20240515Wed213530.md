# NRF52840 USB DFU Programming

This post provides a step-by-step guide on how to program the NRF52840 dongle using the Device Firmware Update (DFU) mode, along with insights on configuring the firmware and using the Nordic SDK.

## Initial Setup and Programming

Out of the box, the NRF52840 dongle comes with tools that allow a variety of operations such as programming and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections without needing additional programming. The desktop application provided by Nordic simplifies these tasks significantly.

Interestingly, the dongle can enter DFU mode automatically without any physical interaction (e.g., pressing buttons). Here’s how you can handle the programming:

### Programming the Dongle via Command Line

1. **Navigate the NRF SDK**: Learn how to explore and compile example projects within the SDK.
2. **Create Custom Firmware**: Set up your firmware, like a simple blinking light example.
3. **Enable Logging Over USB**: Configure the device to send log data over the USB CDC interface.

### Using DFU for Firmware Updates

The dongle supports updating firmware through its bootloader using the `nrfutil` tool. To enter DFU mode manually, you can use the side reset button which triggers a slow glowing red LED, indicating that the device is ready for DFU programming.

**Commands for DFU Programming**:

- To program the device, use:
  ```
  $ nrfutil device program --firmware dfu_package.zip --traits nordicDfu
  ```
- To create a DFU package, use:
  ```
  $ nrfutil nrf5sdk-tools pkg generate --hw-version 52 --sd-req=0x00 --application application.zip --application-version 1 dfu_package.zip
  ```

Ensure not to erase the UICR region; doing so will prevent the bootloader from entering DFU mode. If this happens, you’ll need a JTAG programmer to revert to traditional programming methods.

## Triggering DFU Mode via USB

For those who prefer not to manually press the reset button, you can trigger the DFU mode programmatically by setting the reset pins:

```c
nrf_gpio_cfg_output(BSP_SELF_PINRESET_PIN);
nrf_gpio_pin_clear(BSP_SELF_PINRESET_PIN);
```

This configuration forces the microcontroller to reboot into the bootloader, which then detects the reset and enters DFU mode.

### Automatic DFU Trigger

Nordic provides a USB DFU trigger library which can be included in your firmware to manage this process more smoothly. The device will appear as a new vendor interface, which allows initiating the DFU mode through a control transfer from the host:

```python
libusb1_backend = usb.backend.libusb1.get_backend(find_library=lambda x: "/opt/homebrew/lib/libusb-1.0.0.dylib")
dev = usb.core.find(idVendor=0x1915, idProduct=0x521f, backend=libusb1_backend)
bmRequestType = usb.util.build_request_type(usb.util.CTRL_OUT, usb.util.CTRL_TYPE_CLASS, usb.util.CTRL_RECIPIENT_DEVICE)

try:
    dev.ctrl_transfer(bmRequestType, 0x00, timeout=1)
except usb.core.USBError:
    pass
```

If the dongle reboots but doesn't enter DFU mode, ensure there are no issues in the `components/libraries/bootloader/dfu/nrf_dfu_trigger_usb.c:dfu_trigger_evt_handler()` function and that logging and other configurations are set up correctly to prevent crashes.
