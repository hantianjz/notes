{#- BASIC SUMMARIZATION PROMPT -#}
{#- The following prompt reduces a document to five information dense sentences. If you want your summaries in a language other than English, we recommend rewriting the entire prompt in the target language. You can get quite creative using combinations of logic and variables to enable all kinds of creative use cases. See the documentation for details and examples. -#}

Write five easy-to-read sentences to summarize the following text:

"""
Title: {{ document.title }}
Author: {{ document.author }}
Domain: {{ document.domain}}
{% if (document.content | count_tokens) > 2000 %}
{{ document.content | central_sentences | join('\n\n') }}
{% else %}
{{ document.content }}
{% endif %}
"""

IMPORTANT: Write no more than FIVE sentences. Each sentence should be short and easy-to-read. Use words sparingly and please capture the big idea.
