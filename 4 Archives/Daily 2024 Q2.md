Hi Yuanyuan, sorry I can't do the erg test this week, and unfortunately we really need to have the Springfield roaster ready this week. So unfortunately we had to cut you from the Springfield race, I am sorry about this and understand this may feel unfair given it is my fault you can't do erg test.
Please I would highly encourage you to continue come to practice as much as possible and sign up for 1 on 1 sessions on Sunday. There are still 3 more races this year and plenty of opportunity to paddle if you want. I am also happy to help if you need it.

What was this fight about?
I expressed an emotion that we have a lot of finical responsibility, I feel you became very defensive

Hi all,
Thank you all for signing up for the Springfield race. As I have mentioned today after practice we would like to do a erg test to help us with selection process and also help with determining the line up for the race. We will be doing a 500m erg test. If you have already done a 500m erg test this season, you don't have to do it again for Springfield race, unless you would like to update your score. If you have done a 500m erg test with your alumni team that also counts, just msg me or @Tian with your erg time. In addition if you have access to an erg yourself, you can also do the test yourself just send us the video and result.

For the few folks that have not done a 500m erg test this season, you are welcome to come to my place to test.
I will be available:
- Monday 7/01 5-8pm
- Wednesday 7/03 5-6pm
- Thursday 7/04 noon-5pm
- Sunday 7/07 after practice
Please DM me when would you like to come for the test. If these time slots does not work for you, DM me to figure out a better time for you.
I am located 3 mins walk from the Maguon Square green line stop in Somerville, https://maps.app.goo.gl/hEar2nz5eb4GMJ2Y7, and I will msg you my exact address when you let me know when you are coming.

关于轩轩切包皮。我们为了这件事情已经争吵了很多次了，每次我以为我说服你了，然后别人提起刨皮你又变卦。所有的信息都说了切与不切包皮从医学的角度都是一样的，都各有利弊。不管怎样我们都要教他良好的清洁习惯，就像我们要教他怎么洗屁股。
我在包皮的事情上真的很坚持不要切包皮，因为我觉得这是生理上对他鸡鸡的一种保护。是有存在的必要。
我思考过更深沉的原因为什么我这么在意这件事，因为我希望我的儿子可以多像我一点这样我才能更好的帮助他。我希望我这一生的经验和体验能毫无保留的给他。然而切包皮这件事让我感觉的在他一出生，在一件我们可以控制的事情上他就立刻和我不一样，而且还是男性器官这么隐私敏感的东西。这让我感觉到我和我的儿子之间的一个横沟。我多少会有点难过。
我们认识到现在我从来没有为了一件事情这么坚持，我认真的请求你可以在这件事上能尝试理解我的心情，我也希望能得到你的支持，即使你可能不同意或者不喜欢这个决定。
如果你看完了还坚持你的想法，要给轩轩切包皮我无话可说。我也不会再去反对你，我会支持你的选择。
