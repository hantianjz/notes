# March 10th, 2018, Lukla, Day 0, (2841m)

Flight was actually not that late. Got here super early and cold. The plan is to rest up, eat, get more food into me.

Now it is afternoon, got a big breakfast in me. And some sleep. I am actually the ONLY person in the lodge. this is unbeleivable. This Himalaya lodge is also so big it is probably able to house hundreds if not thousands people at a time.

Also unfortunate to my discovery. I did not bring enough cash. For all 20 days. Maybe enough to last me until day 10. Daily budget will be around $30 or Rs 3000.

Another thing I am worried about is the cold at base camp or during the passes. At lukla, I am already freezing. Don't know how will I fair later on.

The owner's Grand daughter came by to. Oh how cute she is at first, but she is also very energetic. I am tired of her after 1 hour. Kids are needy.

Last night sucked, wake up so many times to God know what. But in good news I am not so cold anymore. I declaration my body fully recovered. I just realized having these uncertainty is all part of fun. The worse is actually not that bad.

The goal today will be to test and experiment with how my body handle this altitude. Already feeling some light shortness of breath.
