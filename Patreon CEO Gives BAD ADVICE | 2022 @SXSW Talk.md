# Patreon CEO Gives BAD ADVICE | 2022 @SXSW Talk
# 1. Advice sucks
- Humility: 
    - So many people get to where they want to go, by admit they were wrong and move on.
    - Check your ego at the door, admit you are wrong, adjust corse.
- Conviction:
    - If you think you are right, stick to your guns.
    
Although these advices are good and came from real experience, they are bad advice. Because for starter they are opposite ideas.
For every human quality, there is a spectrum of it over the whole population. Hence an advice might only really apply to one side of the spectrum, while be really bad advice for the other side of the spectrum.
General advice really only work for the person that is giving the advice and does not apply to the whole population.

- Any advice that presuppose that there is a clear path forward, and that one person knows it and others don't are **bullshit**.
- Take it or leave it for your self.
   
# 2. Customized Design
- Explore and clarify what's wrong
- Define a clear problem statement
- Brainstorm options for solutions
- Commit to and flesh out a plan

## Get started with these questions
- How am I feeling right now? Why? Where is it coming from?
- Are there any narratives I've invented in my head that might be leading me in this wrong direction?
- What's REALLY bothering me? What are the problems?
- In what ways am I causing those problems? How am I contributing to them?
- How many different problems are there? are they related?
- Is there a root cause underneath them all?
- Is anything going well? What? Why?
- What am I trying to accomplish? Where am I trying to get to? How will I know if it's worked?
- What are my options?
- What are the tradeoffs of those options? Are they worth it?
- What hard lessons am I learning right now that might help me do better next time?
Clarify ideas in writing.

# 3. The Inspiration Machine
[Benjamin Zander](https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_the_transformative_power_of_classical_music?language=en) Ted talk is very inspirational.
Finding out the trigger to get into flow state.
Inspiration is luck, sometimes. But it is also in our control.

Take note off when you are inspired.

# 4. Subtract
Try to do less and focus.
There is always item 11, 12, 13 on the TODO list. But focus on knocking out 1-3.

# 5. The Loneliness Epidemic
content =/= world

> [!Charlie Kaufman]
> Say who you are. Really say it in your life and in your work. Tell someone out there who is lost, someone not yet born, someone who won't be born for 500 years. Your writing will be a record of your time. It can't help but be. But more importantly, if you're honest about who you are, you'll help that person be less lonely in their world.
