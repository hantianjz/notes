# Why I love firmware(embedded)

Follow the reference to https://henrikwarne.com/2012/06/02/why-i-love-coding/
> 1. _The sheer joy of making things._ Programming is fundamentally about creating  solutions to problems. At the end of the day, you have created something that didn’t exist that morning, and that is in and of itself satisfying.
> 
> 2. _The pleasure of making things that are useful to other people_. One of most satisfying aspects of the job as a programmer is seeing code you wrote deployed in a live system and used by actual people, especially if it improves their lives in some way.
> 
> 3. _The fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts, and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning_. Very well put. Not only do programs have complex structure and dependencies, there is also the dynamics of the interaction between the parts as the program executes. The ultimate puzzle indeed!
> 
> 4. _The joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task_. While constructing the program you constantly expand your understanding of both the problem and the solution. In addition, there is almost no limit to what you can learn to improve your craft – languages, algorithms, methodology, tools, frameworks.
> 
> 5. _The delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of imagination_. Easily my favorite  in the list – insightful and wonderfully formulated. And he goes on to note that “_yet the program construct, unlike the poet’s words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself_“. Yeah!

[[Notes on The Mythical Man Month - Essays on Software Engineering|Mythical Man-Month]] of [[Brooks's Law]]

I agree with most points above except for #5 where The idea of `Pure thought-stuff...castles in the air...`  just doesn't resonate with me. I think this is because it sounds like more abstractions, and reminded me too much of [[On Abstraction in Software]] I have personally experienced. Modern day software are almost always based on top of lots of layers. It have become almost impossible to fully understand the whole system on any detailed level.

To me this unknown scares me. I always get the feeling that everything is just limping along, where everything barely works. This is most likely the case given the constant high profile security exploit that is surfaced.
