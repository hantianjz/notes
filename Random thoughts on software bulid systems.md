- the build system are typically specific to language,
    - each mature programming language often have their own build system plus a package manager, which they tend to be interdependent, but different thing
    - python have multiple, pyenv, build, or poetry
    - rust have cargo, or also package manager
    - Interpertive language mostly tend to have package manager which is which is the case with Python and Lua
    - C/Cpp by tradition was on Make, but now Cmake have gained popularity
    - make is straightly build system, Cmake is both, it handle package manager and "discovery". Which is a big differentiating thing with Cmake. This feels like a double edge sword.
    - Build system only really matter if a project is large enough with many reusable components and modules. 
    - Manage build artifacts for distribution
    - Embedded system with host tools and target code
    - build system for automating long and tedious steps involved to manage/manipulate code
    - A build system for book writing? Also a project of sort.
    - The extensibility of the build system, alone with the project
    - Almost a product along side the project itself
    - component integration is harder in embedded system due to how vast different each component could be

Introduction:

In the vast landscape of programming languages, the diversity extends beyond syntax and semantics. Each language comes bundled not only with its unique features but also with a specialized set of tools for building and managing code. In this blog post, we'll delve into the intriguing realm of code build systems, emphasizing the language-specific nature of these tools.

1. **Language-Specificity of Build Systems:**
    
    Code build systems are the backbone of software development, responsible for transforming human-readable source code into executable binaries. Interestingly, these systems are not one-size-fits-all; rather, they are tailored to the idiosyncrasies of each programming language. The rationale behind this is that different languages often demand different compilation and dependency resolution processes.
    
2. **Package Managers and Build Systems: A Delicate Dance:**
    
    A common trend in mature programming languages is the symbiotic relationship between build systems and package managers. While they serve distinct purposes, they are often tightly integrated. The package manager handles dependencies, ensuring that the required libraries and modules are present, while the build system orchestrates the compilation and linking processes.
    
3. **Python's Plurality: pyenv, build, and poetry:**
    
    Python, being a versatile language, boasts multiple build systems. Developers can choose from pyenv, build, or poetry, each catering to different preferences and project requirements. The variety reflects Python's commitment to flexibility and adaptability.
    
4. **Rust's Cargo: Beyond a Build System:**
    
    Rust introduces Cargo, a build system that transcends traditional boundaries. Not only does it handle compilation and linking, but it also functions as a package manager. This integration streamlines the development process, making Rust projects more manageable and accessible.
    
5. **Interpreted Languages and Package Managers:**
    
    Interpreted languages, such as Python and Lua, often lean towards package managers as their primary build management tool. The emphasis here is on resolving dependencies and ensuring smooth integration of external libraries into the project.
    
6. **Evolution in C/C++ Build Systems: From Make to CMake:**
    
    C and C++ have a rich history with the venerable Make build system. However, the landscape has evolved, and CMake has emerged as a popular alternative. CMake not only functions as a build system but also plays a pivotal role in package management and project discovery.
    
7. **CMake: The Double-Edged Sword:**
    
    What sets CMake apart is its dual role as both a build system and a package manager. While this versatility brings advantages, it also introduces complexities. The challenge lies in balancing the benefits of streamlined project management with the potential pitfalls of a tool that wears two hats.
    

**Conclusion**:

In the intricate web of programming languages and their associated build systems, one thing is clear: there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The diversity in tools reflects the unique demands of each language and the evolving needs of the developer community. As we navigate this landscape, it's essential to appreciate the delicate dance between build systems and package managers, understanding that the right tool for the job often depends on the specific nuances of the language and the project at hand.
